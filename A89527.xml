         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Had not preſumed to preſent unto you this Book of the Novels of the late Queen your Mother, if the firſt Edition had not omitted or concealed her Name, and ſo changed the whole form of it, that many did not know it; wherefore, to make it worthy of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whenever it was divulged, I gathered together all the original and beſt written Copies that poſſibly I could procure, and justifying them by my own, I have reduced the Book to the true order in which ſhe had dreſſed it. Since by the permiſſion of the King, and your own conſent, it hath been committed to the Preſſe to be publiſhed in that primitive integrity in which it ought to be, which doth prompt me to call into my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory what Count <hi>Balthazar,</hi> in the Preface of his <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier</hi> doth affirm of <hi>Boccace,</hi> that his work of Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, meaning his <hi>Decameron,</hi> did bring him more honour than all thoſe more ſerious pieces which he did compoſe in the <hi>Latin</hi> or the <hi>Italian</hi> tongue. In this ſame manner the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> the true Ornament of our Age (from whom you nothing do degenerate in the love and knowledge of good Letters) exerciſing her witty mirth, and playing on the various Acts of human life, hath

            <head>The PREFACE</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the firſt day of <hi>September,</hi> in which the Baths of the <hi>Pyrenaean</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains doe begin to enter into their greateſt virtues, there were lodged in the Houſes of thoſe that kept the Baths ſeveral perſons, as well of <hi>France</hi> &amp; <hi>Spain</hi> as of other places, Some of them to drink the water, others of them to bath themſelves in it, and ſome again to make uſe of the very mud thereof, which are ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in the effects, that the ſick who have come thither, being forſaken by their Phyſicians, have returned all ſound &amp; in good health. It is not my intention to declare unto you the ſituation or virtue of theſe Baths, but to give you an account of that only which ſhall concern the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of what I write. In theſe Baths the ſick do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue three months and more, untill by their amendment they do find that they are in a good condition to return from whence they came. But at that very time there fell ſuch great &amp; wonderfull ſhowrs, that it ſeemed God had forgot his promiſe which he made to <hi>Noah,</hi> to deſtroy the world no more by water; for all the Cubans and Lodgings of the Hoſts, that were toward the Baths, were ſo fill'd with water, that it was impoſſible to continue in them. Thoſe who came from the Coaſt of <hi>Spain</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Mountains, making what ſhift they could, and thoſe who knew which were the neareſt and moſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ways, were thoſe who eſcaped beſt of all: But the Lords and Ladies of <hi>France</hi> thinking to return as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly as they came forth, did find the ſmall Brooks ſo greatly encreaſed, that they could not ford them, and when they came to paſſe over the River <hi>Gane</hi> in <hi>Bearn,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119929:10"/>which was not two foot in depth when they ſet forth, they found it on their return ſwolln ſo impetuous, that they turned another way to find the bridge, which being made of wood only, was carried away by the violence of the waters; and ſome of them thinking that by the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling together of many men, they ſhould in their paſſage break the courſe of the raging ſtream, they were ſuddenly born down before it, ſo that thoſe who were to follow, did loſe both the power and the deſire to go after them, wherfore as well to find out a new way, as for that they were of ſeveral opinions, they did ſeparate themſelves; Some of them travelled over the hight of the hills, and paſſing by <hi>Arragon</hi> they came into the County of <hi>Rouſillon,</hi> &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence to <hi>Narbon;</hi> Others repaired directly to <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona,</hi> where ſome took ſhipping, &amp; paſſed by Sea to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles,</hi> &amp; others to <hi>Aiguemore:</hi> But an antient Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and of great experience, called <hi>Oyſilla,</hi> did determin with her ſelf to forget all the danger of the bad ways to reach unto our Ladies at <hi>Serrance,</hi> being aſſured that if ſhe could find means to eſcape the danger, that the Monks there would give her courteous entertainment, and ſo much ſhe laboured, that at laſt ſhe arrived to that place, paſſing by ſtrange ways, up hill and down hill, ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, that for all her age and the weight of her body, ſhe was enforced to goe on foot the greateſt part of the way, but the thing moſt to be pittied was that the greateſt part of her Servants and Horſes dyed on the unpaſſable places, ſo that ſhe arrived at <hi>Serrance,</hi> attended only with one Man and one Woman, where ſhe was charitably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Abbot. There was alſo at thoſe Baths amongſt the French two Gentlemen, who travelled thither ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to accompany the Ladies whoſe ſervants they were, than for any indiſpoſition of their bodies. Theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men obſerving the company to depart, and that the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hands of the Ladies did take them along with them, did reſolve with themſelves to follow them at ſome diſtance, that they might not be diſcovered by any. One Evening the two married Gentlemen and their Ladies taking up their lodging at the houſe of one who was rather a Nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man
<pb facs="tcp:119929:10"/>than a Peaſant, the two young Gentlemen were contented to take their repoſe for that night in a Cottage not far from them: About midnight they heard a great noiſe, at the ſound whereof they did ariſe and their Grooms with them, and demanded of the Hoſt of the Houſe what was the occaſion of the Tumult, The poor man who did partake with them in the fear, told them that they were naughty boys who came to a Highway-man who kept an Inn cloſe by him to take a part with him in the booty; Whereupon the two Gentlemen with their Grooms did immediatly arm themſelves, and made hast to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the Ladies, for whom they eſteemed Death to be more happy, than to live after them; And as ſoon as they came unto the houſe, they found the firſt Gate broken open, and the two married Gentlemen gallantly defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their ſervants; but becauſe the Robbers were too numerous, and that they were ſorely wounded, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to retire themſelves, having loſt a great number of their ſervants; the two young Gentlemen looking up to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, beheld the two Ladies weeping and crying out ſo lowdly, that being tranſported with love and pity (like two inraged Bears deſcending from the Mountains) they fell upon the Robbers with ſo much ſury, that having kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a great number of them, thoſe that were leſt not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to come under ſuch violent blowes, did fly unto a place of retreat. The young Gentlemen having thus defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe Aſſaſſinates, of whom the Hoſt himſelf was one, did underſtand that the Hoſteſs was worſe than her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and therefore they did ſend her after him by a thruſt of a Rapier, and entring into one of the lower Chambers, they found one of the married Gentlemen giving up the Ghoſt, the other had received no hurt at all, but onely his cloaths were much ſlaſhed, and run through with ſwords, and his ſword was broken, and being very ſenſible of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which theſe two Gentlemen brought unto him, having embraced them, and thanked them, he deſired that they would not forſake him, which was a requeſt very eaſie unto them to grant, wherefore having interred the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was dead, and comforted his Lady in the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:119929:11"/>manner that they could, they took their way as God did direct them, without knowing on what hand to go. If you pleaſe to underſtand the names of the three Gentlemen and the Ladies, he that was maried was called <hi>Hircan,</hi> and his wife <hi>Parlament;</hi> the other Lady who ſo lately became a Widdow was called <hi>Longeren,</hi> the two Gentlemen who ſo happily came in to their ſuccour, the one of them was named <hi>Dagoucin,</hi> and the other <hi>Saffredant.</hi> After they had been all day on horsback, on the Evening they heard a Bell, to which place, but not without pain and travail, they did their utmoſt endeavour to arrive, and were courteouſly entertained by the Abbot and the Monks; It was the Abbey of Saint <hi>Savin.</hi> The Abbot who was of a noble family (having brought them to their Lodgings, which were magnificent) did demand them of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; And having underſtood the truth thereof, he told them, That they were not alone who ſuffered in that Ruin, for in another Chamber there were two young Ladies who had eſcaped the like danger, and ſo much the greater, by how much there is more compaſſion in Man than in a Beaſt; for the poor Ladies, half a mile on this ſide of <hi>Pyrchita,</hi> had diſcovered a great Bear comming down the Hill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, from whom they ſled with ſo much ſpeed, that at their entrance into his Gates their horſes fell down dead under them, and two of their women who came a long time after them, did inform them, That the Bear had deſtroyed all their ſervants; whereupon the two Ladies, and three Gentlemen, did enter into the Chamber where they were, and found them weeping, and knew that one of them was <hi>Nomerfide,</hi> and the other <hi>Emarſuite,</hi> who imbracing each other did recount what had happened, and began to comfort themſelves, being more incited thereunto by the conſolations of the good Abbot, that thus they met together. On the morning they heard Maſs with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, prayſing God for their deliverance from their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. When they were all at Maſs, Behold a Man who had nothing on him but his ſhirt only, did run into the Church, flying as ſome body had purſued him, and crying aloud for Help. Immediatly <hi>Hircan</hi> and the other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
<pb facs="tcp:119929:11"/>made up to him to ſee what the buſineſs was, and they found two men following him at the heels with their ſwords drawn, who obſerving ſo great a company, would have betaken themſelves to flight, but <hi>Hircan</hi> and thoſe with him did follow them ſo cloſe that they left their lives on the place. When <hi>Hircan</hi> had well obſerved the party that was relieved, and who was in his ſhirt only, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it was <hi>Guebron,</hi> who was one of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who did impart unto them, That lodging in a Cottage near unto <hi>Pyrchita,</hi> there came three men to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him being in bed, who although he was in his ſhirt, he did wound one of them with his ſword in ſuch manner, that immediatly he died, and whiles the other were buſie and in debate where to beſtow him, he obſerving that he was naked, and they armed, did conceive that there was no other way to be too hard for them, but by flight only, which he might the better do being not charged with habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments; and he thanked God and them, who thus had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted vengeance for him on his Enemies. After that they had ſaid Maſs and dined, they ſent to ſee if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to paſſe the River of <hi>Gane,</hi> and underſtanding the impoſſibility of it, they were in a great diſtreſſe, although the Abbot had often offered them to continue there, untill ſuch time as the waters were decreaſed, to which they only accorded for that day. As they were going to bed at night, there arived an old Monk, who every year never failed in <hi>September</hi> to have recourſe unto our Lady at <hi>Serrance,</hi> who being demanded of the occurrences of his Journey, made anſwer, That by reaſon of the high waters he came all along the mountains, and the worſt ways that were ever travelled, where he beheld one ſpectacle of great pity, which was, That he met with a Gentleman cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Simontault,</hi> who being impatient at the long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the over-flowing River, did reſolve to force it, truſting in the goodneſs of his Horſe; to effect which, he did place his ſervants on each ſide of him, to break the furious eddy of the ſtream, but when they were in the middle of it, thoſe who were worſt of all mounted were carried away by the violence of the River, and never did
<pb facs="tcp:119929:12"/>return again. The Gentleman ſeeing himſelf alone, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned back his horſe from whence he came; but his horſe for all his force and promptneſſe did ſink under him: But it pleaſed God that he was ſo near the Bank, that being but four foot from it, and having drank much water, he waded forth, and ſat down upon two flints, ſo weak and feeble that he was not able to ſupport himſelf. It ſo fell out, that a Shepherd driving homeward his flocks in the Evening, did find him almoſt covered with mud upon the ſtones, and no leſſe ſorrowfull for his people, whom he ſaw to be carried away by the River, and deſtroyed before him, than for himſelf: The Shepherd who underſtood his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as well by hearing as by ſeeing him, did take him by the hand, and brought him into his poor Houſe, where with ſmall buſhes he dried him as well as the poverty of his Chimney would permit. On that Evening God brought thither this old Monk, who did direct him in the way to our Ladies at <hi>Serrance,</hi> aſſuring him, that he ſhould find better Lodging there than in any other place, and ſhould meet with an antient Woman, called <hi>Oyſilla,</hi> who would be his Companion in his Travels. When all the Company heard him ſpeak of the good Lady <hi>Oyſilla,</hi> and the gentle Cavalier <hi>Simontault,</hi> they were transported with an exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lience of Joy, praiſing the Creator, who in contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the Servants, had preſerved their Maſters and their Miſtreſſes, and above all <hi>Parlament</hi> was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouteſt in her praiſes; for a time there was in which ſhe eſteemed him for her moſt affectionat ſervant. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diligently enquired concerning the way to <hi>Serrance,</hi> although the good old Man did report it to be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, yet they could not forbear to put it to the adventure, and the next morning they did ſet forth in ſo good order and equipage, that they wanted for no accommodation: For the Abbot did furniſh them with the beſt horſes that were in <hi>Lovedoon,</hi> and with good riding ſuits, and great ſtore of proviſion, and with honeſt Gentlemen to be their Companions and guides over the Mountains, having tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled which, in great labour and ſweat, and more on foot than on horsback, they arrived at our Ladies of <hi>Serrance.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:119929:12"/>The Abbot, although he was a man churliſh enough, did not dare to refuſe to give them intertainment, by reaſon of the fear he had of <hi>Seigneur du Bear,</hi> by whom he knew that they were well beloved; he therefore looked upon them with the beſt Countenance he could, and took them with him to ſee the good Lady <hi>Oyſilla,</hi> and the Gentleman <hi>Simontault.</hi> So great was the joy of all this Company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo miraculouſly aſſembled, that the night ſeemed but ſhort unto them to praiſe God for the mercy beſtowed on them; &amp; on the morning having taken a little reſt, they did reſort to hear Maſſe, and to receive the holy Sacrament of Communion, by which all Chriſtians are united into one, beſeeching him who had brought them together by his bounty, to put a good end to their travells to his glory. After dinner they ſent to know if the waters were any thing diminiſhed, and on the return of the Meſſenger hearing that they were rather encreaſed, and that it would be a long time before they could travell with any aſſurance, they determined with themſelves to make a bridge between two Rocks which did ſtand very near to one another, where yet the planks are to be ſeen, and are of uſe to thoſe that travel by foot, and coming from <hi>Cleron</hi> will not paſs by the <hi>Gane.</hi> The Abbot who was glad that they were at that coſt, becauſe the number of Pilgrims, and Country, Travellers did encreaſe, did provide them with workmen, But his avarice would not permit him to pay one penny towards the work it ſelf, and becauſe the workmen did all affirm that they could not finiſh the bridge in <hi>10</hi> or <hi>12</hi> days, the whole Company, as well both of the Gentlemen as of the Ladies, began to be much perplexed. But <hi>Parlament</hi> the wife of <hi>Hircan,</hi> who was never ſeen either heavy or melancholy, having asked leave of her husband to ſpeak, did ſay to the antient Lady <hi>Oyſilla,</hi> Madam, I do much wonder that you who have ſo great experience, and are in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a Mother amongſt Women, do not find out ſome paſtime to mitigate the ſorrows which we doe bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us during our long aboad in this place; for if we have no exerciſe pleaſant and virtuous, we ſhall be in danger to fall ſick; The young widdow <hi>Longeren</hi> did
<pb facs="tcp:119929:13"/>add unto her words and ſaid, Nay which is worſe, we ſhall grow burthenſom to one another, which is a ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe uncurable, for there is not one of us, if he looks upon his loſs, who hath not an occaſion of exceſſive ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Emarſuite</hi> replyed in ſmiles unto her, Every one hath not loſt her husband as you have, and for the loſſe of our Servants we ought not to deſpair, for we may recover them time enough; Howſoever I do joyn in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with you to have ſome pleaſant exerciſe to paſſe away the time as delighfull as we can. The Company (ſaith <hi>Nomerfide</hi>) hath adviſed very well; for ſhe ſaid, That if ſhe were but one day without ſome Paſtime, ſhe ſhould be dead on the next. All the Gentlemen did accord to the counſell, and beſought Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> that ſhe would be pleaſed to order that which they had to do; who made anſwer, My Children, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a task of me which I find very difficult for me to do, which is to ſhew unto you that Recreation which can divert you from your ſorrows, for having through all the travails of my life ſought out a Remedy for it, I never could find but one, which is the reading of the Holy Bible, in which is found the true and perfect joy of the Mind, from whence the Repoſe alſo and the health of the Body doth proceed; And if you ſhall demand of me what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit it is that keeps me ſo ſound and unperplexed in my old age, It is, That as ſoon as ever I am up, I take into my hands the holy Scripture, and read it, beholding, and with my ſelf contemplating the will of God, who hath ſent his Son into the world for us, to declare the good News, by which he doth promiſe Remiſſion of ſins, and ſatisfaction for all offences, by the gift which he hath given us by his Love, Paſſion, and his Martyrdom. This Conſideration doth adminiſter ſo much joy unto me, that I take my <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and as humbly as poſſibly I can, I ſing with my heart, and pronounce with my voice the bleſſed Pſalms and Hymns, which the Holy Ghoſt compoſed in the heart of <hi>David,</hi> and of other Authors: The Contentment which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, doth do me ſo much good, that all the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows which the day can bring unto me, do ſeem to me to
<pb facs="tcp:119929:13"/>be ſo many <hi>Benedictions,</hi> ſeeing that I have him in my heart by faith who hath born them for me. In the like manner after Supper I retire my ſelf to give ſome food to my Soul by reading ſome godly Book, and in the Evening having recollected with my ſelf whatſoever I have done in the time of the day, I demand pardon of God for my faults, and giving him thanks for his mercies, I take my reſt in his love, fear, and peace, being a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>med and aſſured againſt all Dangers that can approach me. Behold (my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren) the Recreation to which for a long time I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted my ſelf, having ſearched all things, and found no other coutentment for my ſpirit. I am confident that if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very morning you would lay forth one hour in reading, and afterwards in the moſt humble manner exerciſe your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions at the Maſs, that even in this wilderneſs you would find that beauty which it may be you cannot in the greateſt Cities: For he who knoweth God beholde h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> if you will live well, and with Comfort. <hi>Hircan</hi> took the word from her, and ſaid, Madam, Thoſe who have read the holy Bible (as I believe that all of us have) will confeſs that you speak the truth; but you muſt regard that we are not yet ſo mortifyed as to deprive our ſelves of all Paſtime and Corporal Recreation: For if we are in our own houſes, we have Dogs to hunt, and Hawks for the flight; which make us to paſs over and to forget a thouſand fooliſh thoughts. And the Ladies have their works of Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifry, and ſometimes their dancings, in which they honeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do delight themſelves, which cauſeth me (ſpeaking on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the behalf of the men) to deſire that you who are the moſt antient amongſt us, would every Morning read the life unto us which our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt did lead, and the great and admirable works which he hath done for us; And after dinner untill Veſpers, that you will make choice of ſome Paſtime which may not be prejudiciall to the Soul, and be pleaſant to the Body, and ſo with comfort we ſhall paſs over the ten days. Madam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> made anſwer to him; That ſhe had ſo much laboured with her ſelf to
<pb facs="tcp:119929:14"/>forget all the vanities of the world, that ſhe was afraid, they had made a bad choice of her for ſuch paſtimes; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhe would ſubmit to the plurality of voices, deſiring <hi>Hircan</hi> to underſtand what was his opinion firſt of all. For my part (ſaid he) If I thought the paſtime I would chooſe were as agreeable to any of the Company as to my ſelf, my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piniö ſhould quickly be known; wherfore for this time I will hold my peace, and will believe that which others ſhall ſpeak. <hi>Parlament</hi> began to bluſh, thinking that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e ſpoke of her, and half in choler, and half in laughter ſaid, <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> It may be that ſhe whom you ſpeak of can find enough to recompenſe her ſelf if ſhe hath a mind thereunto; but let us leave off this paſtime wherein two of us only can bear part, and let us ſpeak of that which ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us all; whereupon <hi>Hircan</hi> ſaid to all the Ladies, Since my Wife hath ſo well underſtood and expounded, and gloſſed upon my ſenſe, and allegeth that a particular pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtime doth not pleaſe her, I believe that ſhe will be able better than any other to ſpeak of that in which every one will take pleaſure, and from this time I ſhall be of her opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as being he who hath no other opinion but her own. To this all the Company did agree. <hi>Parlament</hi> perceiving that the Lot was fallen upon her, did ſpeak in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, If I knew my ſelf as ſufficient as the Antients who found out the Arts, I would invent ſome play or paſtime to ſatisfy the charge which you have impoſed on me, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious to my ſelf of my knowledge and faculties, which with much trouble can hardly remember things well clone, I ſhall eſteem my ſelf happy to follow cloſe unto thoſe who have already ſatisfied your demand. Amongſt others I do believe that there is not any of you who hath not read over the hundred Novels of <hi>John Boccace,</hi> newly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated out of <hi>Italian</hi> into <hi>French,</hi> which the moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that Name, Monſeigneur the <hi>Daulphin,</hi> Madam the <hi>Daulphineſſe,</hi> Madam <hi>Margaret</hi> have and do ſo highly eſteem, that if <hi>Boccace</hi> could but hear them in the place where he is, he would be revived at the prayſes of ſuch perſons. I have heard that the two Ladies above-named, with many others of the Court, have
<pb facs="tcp:119929:14"/>determined with themſelves to make the like work, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from <hi>Boccace</hi> in one particular, which is, not to make mention of any Novell which is not a perfect Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. And firſt of all the ſaid Ladies and Monſeigneur the <hi>Daulphin</hi> did conclude amongſt themſelves to make every one of them Ten, and to have a Liſt of Ten perſons whom they conceived to be moſt worthy to give an account of them, thoſe being to be excepted out of that number who were given to their ſtudy, and were lettered men; for Monſteur the <hi>Daulphin</hi> would not that their art ſhould be mingled in theſe Novells, and was alſo afraid that the beauty of their Rhetorick ſhould in ſome part be prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to the truth of this Hiſtory. But the great affairs which ſince have taken up the King, and the Peace betwixt him and the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the lying down of Madam the <hi>Daulphineſſe,</hi> and many other things worthy to divert the whole Court, have made all that enterpriſe to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which now by reaſon of our long leiſure may be brought unto a period, attending till the Bridge be made. And if you pleaſe that every day preſently after twelve of the clock we ſhall meet, and continue untill four in yonder Meadow by the River of the <hi>Gauve,</hi> where the Trees are ſo leavie, that the Sun can neither prejudice the ſhade, nor grow ſo hot as to vex the freſhneſſe of the air, being there ſat at eaſe, every one ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the City of <hi>Alençon,</hi> in the time of Duke <hi>Charles</hi> the laſt, there was a Proctor called St. <hi>Aignan</hi> who had married a Gentlewoman of that Country more fair than virtuous, who for her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and delightfullneſs was much covered by a Prelat of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119929:16"/>Church, whoſe name in reverence to his profeſſion I ſhall conceal; He, the better to arrive unto his own ends, did ſo cunningly entertain her husband, that he not only perceivd not any thing of the vice of his wife and of this Prelat, but he had made him alſo to forget the duty which he always carried to the ſervice of his Maſters and Miſtreſs, Inſomuch that of a Loyal Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant he became ſo contrary, that in the end he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to ſorceries to procure the Death of the Dutcheſſe. Long time did this Prelate live thus with this unhappy womam who was obedient to him more for avarice than for affection; her husband alſo did ſollicit her to entertain him. But there was a young man in the ſaid City of <hi>Alençon,</hi> the Son of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General, whom ſhe affected with ſo much paſſion that ſhe was almoſt tranſported with the violence of it, and often times ſhe would make uſe of the Prelat to imploy her husband in ſome Commiſſion abroad, that more opportunely ſhe might be enabled to be with the Son of the Lieutenant of the City. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of life did continue a long time; ſhe had for her profit the Prelat, and for her pleaſure the Son of the Lieutenant, to whom ſhe did ſwear that all the indearments of affection ſhe profeſſed to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat were but only more freely to continue their own, and whatſoever the thing was, the ſaid Prelat had but only a fair word, and he might be aſſured, that no man in the world ſhould have an intereſt in any other thing but himſelf only. One day when her Husband was going to the Prelat, ſhe demanded leave of him to take the air of the fields, alleging that the cloſeneſſe of the City was obnoxious to her health. She no ſooner arrived at her Country houſe, but immediatly ſhe did write to the Son of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, deſiring him that he would not fail to come to her about 10 of the clock in that Evening, which the poor young Man did, and being come into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance at the Door, he found there the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid who was accuſtomed to let him in, who ſaid
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119929:16"/>unto him, Sir, You may go ſome where elſe, for your place is taken up. The Young man conceiving that her Husband was come home, demanded what was the Buſineſs? The Maid taking pity of him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo young, ſo lovely, ſo ingenious, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to love ſo well, and ſo little to be beloved again, declared to him the folly of her Miſtreſſe, conceiving with her ſelf, that when he underſtood what ſhe was, he would reprove himſelf for the exceſſe of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. She therefore did inform him, that the Prelat did make his daily viſitations to her, and was now in bed with her. This was, howſoever, a meeting which her Miſtreſſe expected not; for the Prelat was not to come untill the next Morning, who having detained her Husband at his own houſe, did ſteal away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately by Night to come unto her. Who was almoſt ſunk now into the bottom of Deſpair? It was the Son of the Lieutenant, who nevertheleſs could hardly give credit to it, but did hide himſelf in a houſe hard by, where he watched untill three of the clock in the Morning, at what hour he ſaw the Prelat come forth, not ſo well diſguiſed, but that he knew him better than he deſired. In this Diſcontent he returned to <hi>Alençon,</hi> whither not long afterwards his unfaithfull Miſtreſſe did arrive, and thinking to abuſe him (as ſhe had been accuſtomed heretofore) ſhe did ſend to communicate with him: But he made anſwer, That ſhe was too great a Saint, having been touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with holy things, to confer with ſuch a Sinner as himſelf, whoſe repentance howſoever was ſo great, that he hop'd his offence ſhould ſuddenly be pardon'd. When ſhe apprehended that her Caſe was diſcover'd, and that neither Excuſe, Oath, nor Promiſe could induce him to return unto her, but were all of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhe made her complaint unto her Prelat, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſulted with him about it, ſhe came unto her Husband and told him, That ſhe durſt no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the City of <hi>Alençon,</hi> by reaſon that the Son of the Lieutenant, whom ſhe had placed in the firſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119929:17"/>rank of all her friends, did of late inceſſantly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune her to the violation of her Honour. She deſired him to make his aboad at <hi>Argentan</hi> to take away all ſuſpition; Her Husband, who in all things ſuffer'd himſelf to be govern'd by her, did accord unto it, where they were not long, but this miſchievous woman did write unto the Son of the Lieutenant, That he was the moſt wicked man in the world, and that ſhe ſufficiently underſtood that publickly he had ſpoken diſgracefully of her ſelf, and of the Prelat, for which ſhe would make him to do pennance. This young Man who had never made the leaſt mention of it to any but to her ſelf, and who fear'd to ſuffer in the bad opinion of the Prelat, did repair to <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> with two of his ſervants, where he found his Lady at her Evening Devotions in the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> and having kneeled down cloſe unto her, he ſaid, Lady, I am come hither to proteſt unto you before God, that I have not ſpoken to any in the world concerning you, but to your ſelf onely; You have done me ſo ill an office, that I cannot reckon up unto you one moiety of the Injuries which you deſerve: For if there be any Man or Woman who dares affirm that I have ever ſpoken any thing in the diſhonour of you, I am come to prove them lyars before you. She obſerving that there were many people in the Church, and that he was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with two ſervants well appointed, did conſtrain herſelf to ſpeak as gently to him as poſſibly ſhe could, ſaying, That ſhe made no doubt but that he ſpake the truth, and that ſhe conceived him to be ſo much a Gentleman, as not to ſpeak in the prejudice of any Woman in the world, much leſſe of her ſelf who had born ſuch reſpects of friendſhip to him. But becauſe her Husband had underſtood that ſome words had paſſed, ſhe deſir'd him that he would declare himſelf before him, to give him ſatisfaction that he had not ſpoken any thing in this nature, and to take away from him the belief of it. To this moſt willingly he agreed, and having his hand under her arm to conduct her to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119929:17"/>her own Lodging, ſhe told him that it would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo well if he ſhould go along with her; for her Husband might believe, that of her accord ſhe had brought him to ſpeak theſe words unto him: She took hold therefore of one of his ſervants by the ſleeve of his garment, and ſaid, Let this man go along with me, and on the firſt opportunity I will ſend for you, in the mean time, go take your repoſe in your own Lodging. He not having the leaſt thought of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon him, did return unto his Lodging. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a Supper on that ſervant whom ſhe had detei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with her, who oftentimes would ask, when the hour would come that he ſhould go for his Maſter, ſhe alwayes did make anſwer, that it would come ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. When it was Midnight, ſhe privatly ſent one of her own ſervants to the Young-man, who not thinking of the treachery that was prepared, went with confidence to the houſe of St. <hi>Aignan,</hi> in which the Gentlewoman deteined one of his ſervants, ſo that he had then but one of them with him. When he was at the entrance into the Houſe, the ſervant that was ſent for him told him, that his Miſtreſſe would willingly ſpeak with him alone, before he ſhould come to his Maſter, for which purpoſe ſhe did attend him in a private room, where there was none with her but his own ſervant, and that he ſhould therefore doe well to ſend back his other ſervant which was with him, which was done accordingly, and coming up a little pair of ſtairs which were very dark, <hi>Aignan</hi> who had placed an Ambuſcado below in the Wardrobe, did begin to hear the noiſe, and demanded, who was there? It was anſwered, A man who privately would enter into his houſe. Immediately, one named <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Guerin,</hi> who made it his trade to be a Murcherer, and who to execute this Murder was well rewarded by the Proctor, did give, with other of the Aſſaſſinates, this Young-man ſo many cuts with their ſwords, that what defence ſoever he could make, it could not ſave him from falling down dead upon the ſtairs. His ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119929:18"/>who was in diſcourſe with the Lady, ſaid, I hear my Maſter talking on the ſtairs, I will go to him. The Lady with-held him, and ſaid unto him, Take no care, he will come time enough; And not long aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hearing that his Maſter cried out I am a dead Man, I commend my Spirit unto God, he would have made haſt to his aſſiſtance; but ſhe again reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and ſaid, Let him alone, My Husband doth onely chaſtiſe him for ſome youthfull tricks of his; We will go ſee how it is; And leaning over the head of the Stair-caſe, ſhe ſpake unto her Husband, What! is it done? He made anſwer, Come and ſee; I have now revenged you on him who hath procured ſo much ſhame unto you: And ſpeaking theſe words, he with his Poynado gave him ten or twelve thruſts into his Belly being dead, whom living he durſt never have aſſaulted. After this homicide was committed, and the two ſervants of this murdered Young man were fled to tell this ſad News to his poor Father, the ſaid <hi>Aignan</hi> conceiving that this Murder could not be kept ſecret, did take care that the ſervants of the young Gentleman that was ſlain might not be believed as Witneſſes, and finding, beſides, that there were none in his houſe conſcious to the fact, but the Murtherers themſelves, and an antient Chambermaid, and a young Girl of about fifteen yeers of Age, he would privately have made ſure of the old Woman; but ſhe contrived a way to eſcape out of his hands, and lived in ſafety in the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> and was the ſureſt Witneſſe that could be of this Murder. The young Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid continued ſome days afterwards in the houſe, but he found a means to ſuborn her by one of the Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and brought her unto <hi>Paris,</hi> to the publick place there, that her teſtimony might not be received. And the more to conceal the Murder, he cauſed the body of the poor dead Man to be burned, and the bones which were not conſumed with the fire, he did throw into a Morter, where ſome new buildings were raiſing in his houſe. In great diligence he ſent to the Court
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119929:18"/>to obtain his pardon, alleging, That he had often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbidden a yong man to come into his houſe, of whom he had a great ſuſpition to have attempted the diſhonor of his Wife, who for all his prohibition, came by night thither into a ſuſpected place to communicat with her, whereupon finding him at the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Chamber, being filled more with Choler, than with reaſon, he did kill him. But he could not ſo ſoon diſpatch his Letter to the Chancery, but the Duke and the Dutcheſſe were by the poor Father of the Dead advertiſed of the Caſe, who had ſent to the Chancellor to hinder the comming forth of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. The wretched Proctor (ſeeing he could not obtain it) did flie into <hi>England,</hi> and his Wife with him, and ſome others of his Kinred; But before his departure he told the Murderer (who at his requeſt had given this fatal blow) That he had ſeen an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe from the King to apprehend him, and have him put to Death; but becauſe of the ſervice he had done him, he ſaid He would preſerve his Life, whereupon he gave him ten Crowns to go out of the Kingdom, which accordingly he did, and was never heard of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. This Murder was ſo throughly proved, as well by the ſervants of the dead Young-man, as by the Chamber-maid retired into the <hi>Jacobins,</hi> as alſo by the Bones found in the Mortar, that the Proceſſe was made &amp; perfected in the abſence of the ſaid <hi>Aignan</hi> &amp; his wife, who were both judged for their contumacy, &amp; condemn'd to loſe their lives, &amp; to have their goods confiſcated to the King, &amp; 1500 Crowns to be awarded to the Father for the charges of the Proceſſe. The ſaid <hi>Aignan</hi> reſiding in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; ſeeing that by Juſtice he was but a dead man in <hi>France,</hi> did ſo prevail there by his ſervice to many of the Nobility, and by the ſavour of the Kindred of his Wife, that the K. of <hi>England</hi> did make a requeſt to the King of <hi>France</hi> to vouchſafe him a Pardon, and to repoſſeſſe him in his Goods and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; but the King having underſtood the villanous and horrid Act, did ſend the Proceſſe to the King of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119929:19"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> and deſired him to conſider if ſuch a caſe deſerved pardon or not, adding beſides, that the Duke of <hi>Alençon</hi> had in his Kingdome the only privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to grant pardons for offences committed in his own Dutchy. But for all theſe excuſes the King of <hi>England</hi> deſiſted not, but purſued his requeſt with ſuch importunity, that in the end the Proctor obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a pardon, and teturned to his own houſe, where to compleat his iniquity he acquainted himſelf with a Sorcerer whoſe name was <hi>Gallery,</hi> hoping by his Art that he ſhould be exempted from paying the fifteen hundred Crowns to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the young Man that was murthered. To this end he came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and his wife with him, being both diſguiſed; His Wife obſerving that every day he locked himſelf up in a Chamber with the ſaid <hi>Gallery,</hi> &amp; that he not acquainted her with the reaſon of it, one morning ſhe watched him, and obſerved that the ſaid <hi>Gallery</hi> did ſhew him five Images of wood, three of them had their hands banging down, and two of them had their hands lifted up, and ſpeaking to the Proctor he ſaid, we are to make in wax ſuch Images as theſe are, thoſe who have their Arms hanging down ſhall be thoſe that ſhall die, and thoſe who do lift up their hands ſhall be thoſe whoſe favour and countenance we deſire. The Proctor ſaid unto him, This ſhall be then for the King by whom I deſire to be favoured, and this ſhall be for Monſeiur <hi>Brinon</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>Alençon. Gallery</hi> ſaid unto him, we muſt put theſe Images under the Altar at what time they are hearing Maſſe, and you ſhall utter ſome words which at that inſtant I will teach you to ſpeak, And proceeding their diſcourſe concerning thoſe Images which held down their hands, the Proctor told him that one of them was for Monſeiur <hi>Giller du Meſtrill</hi> the father of the young Man that was killed, for he ſufficiently underſtood, that ſo long as he lived he would not ceaſe to purſue him; And one of the women who had their hands
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119929:19"/>hanging down was for Madam the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Alen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon,</hi> Siſter to the King, becauſe ſhe ſtood ſo well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to her old Servant <hi>Du Meſtrill;</hi> and in many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things had ſo perfect a knowledge of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Proctor, that if ſhe died not, he could not live. The ſecond woman that had her Arms han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging down was for his own wife, who was the cauſe of all his troubles, and who (he was ſure enough) would never amend her wicked life. When his wife ſaw all this through the Crevis of the Door, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that he had ranked her amongſt the number of the dead, ſhe reſolvd with her ſelf that ſhe would be before hand with him, &amp; under pretence of borrowing ſome moneys of her Uncle who was maſter of requeſts to the Duke of <hi>Alençon,</hi> ſhe repaired to him to give him an account of what ſhe had ſeen and heard from her Husband. Her Uncle (as became a good old Servant) did addreſſe himſelf to the Chancellor of <hi>Alençon,</hi> and repeated the whole ſtory to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Duke and the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Alençon</hi> were not that day at the Court, the ſaid Chancellor repaired to Madam the Queen Regent the Mother of the King, and to the Dutcheſſe, to give them an account of it, who immediately ſent for the Provoſt of <hi>Paris</hi> called <hi>Battre,</hi> who uſed ſuch diligence that he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Proctor and <hi>Gallery</hi> the Conjurer, who without rack or conſtraint did freely confeſſe the fact, and their Proceſſe was made and brought unto the King. Some of the Court being willing to have their lives ſaved, pleaded for them, and told the King that in their inchantments they deſired only to have his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But the King who eſteemed his Siſters life as dear unto him as his own, did command that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death ſhould be given, as if they had made an attainder upon his own Perſon. Nevertheleſſe his Siſter the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Alençon</hi> did ſo ſupplicate to have the life of the Proctor ſaved, and the ſentence of his death to be turned into ſome other grievous and corporal puniſhment, that it was at laſt condiſcended
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119929:20"/>to, and he and <hi>Gallery</hi> were both condemned and ſent to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to ſerve in the Galleys of Saint <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quart,</hi> where they finiſhed their days in great captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and had the leiſure to acknowledge the grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their offences. The wicked woman in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her Husband did continue her tranſgreſſions more than ever before, and died lamentably.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lades, I do beſecsh you to obſerve what evill doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from wicked women; How many ſorrows did this one produce? You ſhall find, that ever ſince</hi> Eve <hi>cauſed</hi> Adam <hi>to ſin, all Women have made it their profeſſion, to torment, to kill, and to damn Men. As for my ſelf, I have ſuch experience of their cruelty, that I think to die no otherwiſe, but only by the Deſpair into which one of them has thrown me, and yet I am ſo fooliſh, that I muſt confeſſe that this Hell is more pleaſing to me comming from her hand, than Paradiſe could be comming from the hand of another.</hi> Parlament <hi>ſeeming not to underſtand that ſhe was the Subject on whom thoſe words reflected, did reply unto him, If Hell be ſo pleaſant as you expreſs it, you need not to fear the Devil who hath put you there. He made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to her in Choler, If my Devil had been as black as ſcornfull, he would put this Company into as great a fear, as I take pleaſure to behold it; But the Fire of Love doth make me to forget that of this Hell; And to ſpeak no more of it, I do give my voice to Madam</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>being aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if ſhe would but ſpeak of Women what ſhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhe would favour my opinion. Immediatly the whole Company turned towards her, intreating her that ſhe would be pleaſed to begin, which ſhe accepted of, and ſmiling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus to ſpeak; Ladies, It doth appear to me that he who hath given me his voice hath ſpoken ſo much ill of Women, though in the true ſtory of a moſt wicked one, that I ought to run back over all my old years to find out one whoſe virtue might give a check to this bad opinion; And becauſe already I have thought of one not worthy to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, I will give you an account of her.</hi>

               <p>IN the City of <hi>Ambois</hi> there dwelled a Keeper of Mules who ſerved the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> Siſter to King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt of that Name, who was brought to Bed of a Son at <hi>Blois,</hi> to which place the Keeper of the Mules repaired to be payed for his Quarters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. His Wife continued ſtill at <hi>Ambois,</hi> and lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not far from the Bridge. Her Husband had a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who for a long time did love her ſo deſperately, that one day he could not contain fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaking to her, but ſhe who was a moſt virtuous Woman did reprove him ſo ſeverely, threatning that her Husband ſhould beat him, and put him away, that after that time he durſt not ſpeak to her any more, nor make any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Love, but kept that fire concealed in his heart; Untill that on a time his Maſter was gon out of Town, and his Miſtreſſe was at the Veſpers at St. <hi>Florentines,</hi> a Church belonging to the Caſtle of the City, and a great way from her own houſe. Being alone, it came into his head, to enjoy that by force which by no prayer or ſervice he could obtain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he did break down a board which was the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt his Miſtreſſe Chamber and that wherein he lay, but becauſe there was a hanging cloath neer to the Bed of his Maſter and Miſtreſſe, which did co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the walls ſo well, that the rupture which he made could not be perceived, his malice and treachery was not diſcovered untill that his Miſtreſſe was in bed with a Girl ſhe kept of about twelve years of age. As the poor woman was in her firſt ſleep, her ſervant came in his ſhirt only, into her bed, through the whole made in the wall, and had a ſword drawn in his hand; But as ſoon as ſhe perceived him to draw near unto her, ſhe leaped out of the Bed, and uſed all tho reaſons and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119929:21"/>perſwaſions to him as it was poſſible for a good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to deliver; but he who was tranſported with a Beſtial deſire, and did underſtand better the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Mules, than her honeſt Remonſtrances, did ſhew himſelf more brutiſh than the Beaſts with whom ſo long time he converſed; for obſerving that ſhe did run round the Table, and that he could not take hold of her, and withall that ſhe was ſo ſtrong, that twice together ſhe got off from him, growing into a deſpair ever to enjoy her alive, he gave her with his ſword a great blow upon the back, conceiving to himſelf, if neither fear nor force could make her to yeeld, that pain ſhould effect it. But it proved contrary to his expectation: for as a gallant Soldier ſeeing his blood is more inflamed to revenge himſelf on his Enemies, and to purchaſe honour; ſo her chaſt heart did doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inforce her to run, and to flie from the hands of this wicked villain, and oftentimes, at ſome diſtance, ſhe would hold him in the beſt diſcourſe ſhe could, to ſee if by any means ſhe could reduce him to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of his offence; but he was inflam'd with ſuch a furie that there was no place in him to receive good counſell, inſomuch that he gave the poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man many wounds more, which to avoyd, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ran from him, as long as her leggs were able to carry her, and when by the great effuſion of her blood ſhe found that Death approached, joyning her hands together, and lifting her eyes to Heaven ſhe gave thanks unto God, the God of Power, Virtue, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Chaſtity, and beſought him to accept of her blood, which by his appointment was ſhed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and obedience to that of his Sons, in whom ſhe moſt aſſuredly did beleeve that all her ſins were waſhed and wiped away from the Memory of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; And ſpeaking, Lord receive my Soul, which by thy mercy hath been redeemed, ſhee fell on her face upon the Earth, where the bloody Miſcreant did ſtill print more wounds on her body, and when ſhe had loſt both her ſpeech and the ſtrength of her body, the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119929:21"/>Villain ſeiſed upon her by force who no longer could defend her ſelf, and having ſatisfied his reprobate concupiſcence, he fled away ſo haſtily, that for all the Hue and Cryes that did follow him, he could never be heard of more. The young Girle who lay with this poor woman, being overcome with fear, did hide her ſelf under the bed, but when ſhe ſaw that the Man was gone, ſhe came unto her Miſtreſſe, and found her without ſpeech or motion, whereupon ſhe cryed to the neighbors out of the window to come to her aſſiſtance. They who did love and as much reſpect her as any woman in the City did immediatly come to her, and brought with them two Chirurgions, who found that ſhe had on her body five and twenty mortal wounds; they did what they could to keep that little life that was left in her, but it was impoſſible, Yet ſhe continued languiſhing away for the Space of a whole hour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking any word, making ſigns with her eyes and hands, by which ſhe ſhewed that ſhe had not loſt her underſtanding. Being asked by a Church-man of the Faith in which ſhe dyed, and of her Salvation, ſhe made anſwer by ſigns ſo evident that her words could not more manifeſtly declare that her confidence was in the Death of Jeſus Chriſt, whom ſhe hoped to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in his coeleſtial City; and thus with a joyfull countenance, lifting up her eyes to heaven, ſhe ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her chaſt Body to the Earth, and her Soul to her Cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Being taken up and a ſhrowd caſt on her, her Body was no ſooner brought down to the Door of her houſe attending the coming of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to her burial, but behold her poor Husband did arrive, who firſt ſaw the dead Body of his wife at the Door of his houſe, before he had heard the melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly news of her death; And having underſtood the occaſion of it, he had double reaſon to lament, which he did in ſuch a manner that he almoſt had loſt his life. Thus this Martyr of Chaſtity was carried to her burial into the Church of Saint <hi>Florencin,</hi> where all the good women of the City did not fail in their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119929:22"/>endeavours to accompany her, and did honour her as much as poſſibly they could, eſteeming themſelves moſt happy to be of that City in which ſo virtuous a woman lived. The fooliſh and light Huswives beholding the honour that was done unto her, did reſolve with them ſelves to change their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton lives.</p>

                  <hi>You have heard, Ladies, a true Hiſtory, which ought to make our hearts more circumspest to guard this honorable Virtue of Chaſtity. And we that are deſcended of noble Families ought even to die for ſhame to find in our hearts that ſenſuality, to avoid which, a poor Mule-Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers wife did not fear ſo cruell a Death. Alas! How many are there who esteem themſelves good women, and yet never underſtood what it is to reſeſt unto Bloud? Wherefore we ought to exerciſe our ſelves with repentance and humility; for the Graces of God are not given unto us for our nobleneſs or our riches, but according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Bounty, who is no accepter of perſons, and who chooſeth whom he pleaſeth. For thoſe whom he chooſeth he doth honour with his virtues, and doth crown them with his glory; and oftentimes he maketh choice of baſe things, to confound thoſe which the world eſteems to be high and honourable. Therefore (as he himſelf ſaith) let us not rejoice in our greatneſs, but in this, that our Names are written in the Book of Life. There was not a Lady in the Company that had not tears in her eyes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of the lamentable and glorious Death of that poor Woman. Every one reſolved with themſelves that if the like fortune ſhould befall them, they would imitate the ſame Martyr. Madam</hi> Oyſilla <hi>obſerving that the Time did paſſe away in the many praiſes of this dead Woman, did ſay to</hi> Saffredant, <hi>If you ſpeak not ſomething to make the Company laugh, I do not ſee any amongſt you, who can forget the fault I have committed, which is, to make you weep. Wherefore I give you my voice.</hi> Saffredant <hi>had a deſire to ſpeak ſome good thing which might be agreeable to the Company, and above all to one of them, how ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome wrong was done, in regard that there were ſome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119929:22"/>more antient and more experienced than himſelf, who ſhould have spoke before him. Nevertheleſs his lot being ſuch, he had rather diſpatch it now, for there were more to come of good speakers, and the longer he ſtayed, the more his Account would appear leſſe pleaſing.</hi>

               <p>LAdies, ſaid <hi>Saſſredant,</hi> Becauſe I have oftentimes wiſhed my ſelf to be a companion of his Fortune of whom I am now giving you an account, I ſhall tell you, That in the City of <hi>Naples,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> whoſe Luſt was the Scepter of his Realm, there was a Gentleman ſo gallant, goodly, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, that for his perfections an antient Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave him his Daughter in Marriage, which in Beauty and ſweetneſſe of Diſpoſition was nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to her Husband. The Love between theſe two was great, untill that wanton time when the King in a Maſque did go amongſt the Houſes of the Great Ones of his Kingdom, where every one did ſtrive to give him the greateſt entertainment that they could, and when he came into the houſe of this Gentleman, he was more magnificently received than in any other place, as well by Collations, as by Songs and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and by the moſt beautifull Lady that ever he beheld, who at the end of the Feaſt did bear a part in a Song with her Husband, which ſhe did with ſo much grace, that it did encreaſe her beauty. The King beholding two perfections in one body, took not ſo much pleaſure at the mutuall according of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119929:23"/>and the Wife, as he took care how to diſſolve it. He found the difficulty to perform it was in the united affection which he obſerv'd betwixt them; Therefore he carried in his heart his paſſion as cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as poſſibly he could, but to comfort it in part he made many Feaſts to all the Lords and Ladies of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> at which this Gentleman and his Wife were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forgotten. And becauſe that we do willingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which we ſee, it ſeemed to him that the fair eyes of this Lady did promiſe him ſome Good to come, if the Preſence of her Husband did give no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to it; and to make tryall if this conjecture of his were true or not, he gave her Husband a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go to <hi>Rome</hi> for fifteen dayes, or three weeks, and as ſoon as he was gon, his Wife who never before was deprived of the ſight of him, made many great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for which ſhe was comforted by the King as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as he could, by his perſwaſions, and by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, Inſomuch that at laſt ſhe was not only comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but contented alſo with the abſence of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and before the three weeks were expired that her Husband ſhould return, ſhe was ſo amorous of the King, that ſhe was as much grieved at the return of her Husband as ſhe was at his going from her; And that ſhe might not loſe the preſence of the King ſhe did conclude with him, that when her Husband did goe unto his Houſes in the Country, ſhe would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with it, who then with aſſurance might come unto her, and ſo ſecretly, that no man (whom ſhe feared more than her own Conſcience) could have any notice of it. In this hope the Lady remained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry joyfull, and when her Husband was come home ſhe gave him ſuch good entertainment, that although he underſtood that in his abſence the King made very much of her, yet he could not receive it into his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. But in the proceſſe of time, the fire ſo hard to be concealed did by degrees begin to ſhew it ſelf, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that her Husband began to have a ſtrong ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her, and did keep over her ſo ſtrict a watch,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119929:23"/>that he was almoſt aſſured of the Truth. But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the fear that did invade him, that he who had done him this injury, would do him a greater, if he ſhould make it known, he teſolved with himſelf to diſſemble it, for he believed it to be ſafer to live, though with ſome diſcontent, than to hazard his life for a Woman that had forfeited her love. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in this deſpite he reſolved to render the like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, if it were poſſible; And knowing that Love doth aſſail thoſe moſt of all who have a heart great and honourable, he aſſumed the boldneſſe one day talking with the Queen, to tell her, That he did extremely pity her that ſhe was no better beloved of the King her Husband. The Queen, who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the familiarity of the King and his Wife, made anſwer, I cannot enjoy Honour and Pleaſure together; I know very well that I have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of which another receives the Pleaſure, and ſhe that hath the Pleaſure cannot enjoy the Honor which I have. He who underſtood ſufficiently upon what account thoſe words were ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, replied to her, Madam, Honour is born with you, for you are of ſo high-born an extract, that to be Queen or an Empreſs doth not augment your nobility, but your beauty, grace, and ſweetneſs doth deſerve ſo much pleaſure, as ſhe who hath taken that from you which belongs unto you doth doe more wrong to her ſelf than you; ſhe for a little glory which turns into her ſhame, doth loſe as much pleaſure as you or any Lady in the Land can enjoy, and I can tell you Madam, that if the King would but put the Crown from off his head I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident he had no advantage above me in giving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent unto a Lady, being ſure that to ſatisfie ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant a perſonage as your ſelf he ought to change his complexion into mine. The Queen in laughter made anſwer to him, Although the King be not of ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a complexion as your ſelf, ſo it is that the love which he bears to me doth ſo much content me, that I prefer it above any other thing. The Gentleman
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119929:24"/>ſaid unto her, Madam, If it were ſo, you ſhould not pitty me, for I know well that the honeſt love of your heart would give all contentment, if it ſound the like love in the heart of the King, but God hath ſo appointed it, that (not finding in him that which you expected) you ſhould not make to your ſelf any God on earth. I doe confeſſe unto you ſaid the Queen, that the love I bear him is ſo great, that the like cannot be found in any other heart but my own. Pardon me Madam, ſaid the Gentleman, you have not yet ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the love of all hearts, for I dare profeſſe unto you, that ſuch a one doth love you, whoſe affection is ſo great an inſupportable, that yours in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his would appear nothing at all: And becauſe he finds the love of the King to decreaſe towards you, and his own moſt infinitely augmented, if it be agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, you ſhall be recompenſed for all your ſufferings. The Queen as well by his countenance as by his words did begin to underſtand that what he ſpake did proceed from the bottom of his heart, and did conſider with her ſelf it was long ſince that he firſt profeſſed ſervice to her with ſuch affection that he became melancholy therewith, which at firſt ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be occaſioned by his wife, but now ſhe firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed that it was for the love of her. And thus the virtue of Love which can make it ſelf to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived when it is not counterfit, doth alſo make it ſelf certain of that which is hid from all the world. And looking on the Gentleman who was more lovely than her own Husband, finding that he was forſaken by his wife, as ſhe was by the King, being poſſeſſed with deſpite and Jealouſie of her Husband, and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the love of the Gentleman, ſhe began to ſpeak with tears and ſighes, O my God! And can venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance then force that from me which no Love could ever do? The Gentleman who well underſtood the ſenſe of her words, made anſwer, Madam, Sweet is his Vengeance who inſtead of killing an Enemy, doth give life to a perfect friend. It appears to me, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119929:24"/>it is now high time, that Truth, and a juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable love, ſhould take from you that ſottiſh love which you bear to him who loves not you. Chaſe from you that ſordid fear which cannot have a Manſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a heart great and noble. Let us lay aſide, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, the greatneſſe of your Eſtate, and regard that you and my ſelf are the moſt laugh'd at Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world, betrayed by thoſe whom moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly we have loved. Let us revenge our ſelves, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, not ſo much to render them their deſerts, as to ſatisfie Love, which on my part cannot any longer be ſuſtained without Death: And I beleeve, if you have not a heart more hard than a flint, or diamond, that it is impoſſible for you not to feel ſome ſparks of that fire, which ſo much the more increaſeth in me, as I endeavour to conceal it; And if that pity on me who die for the love of you, cannot incite you to love me, at leaſt let the pity which you ought to have on your ſelf conſtrain you to it, who being ſo abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, do deſerve to be the Miſtreſſe of the hearts of all the gallant Men in the world, and are undervalued and forſaken by him for whom you have diſdained all others. The Queen hearing theſe words was ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that ſhe was afraid to ſhew by her countenance the trouble of her ſpirit, &amp; leaning on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Gentleman ſeeing her half vanquiſhed, when they were come to the end of an Alley where none could deſcry them, did by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect declare that love unto her which ſo long a time he concealed, and thus with delight they both fulfill'd their vengeance, the paſſion whereof before was ſo unſupportable to them. They determined there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both, that as often as he repaired to his Country houſe, and the King ſhould come from his Palace into the Town to her, that immediately he ſhould come about, and return to the Palace to the Queen: And thus deceiving the deceivers, they were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119929:25"/>all four partakers in that pleaſure which two of them thought to have had alone by themſelves. The agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being made, they returned, the Queen to her Chamber in the Palace, and the Gentleman to his houſe, both of them with ſuch content, that they had forgot all their former diſtractions. And the fear which before poſſeſſed them that the King was with this Gentlemans wife, was now turn'd into a deſire to have it ſo, which was the cauſe that the Gentleman more often than he was accuſtomed did repair unto his Village, which was but half a mile from the City, and as ſoon as the King underſtood of it, he did not fail to give a viſitation to his Wife, and when ever night drew on, the Gentleman did conſtantly come into the Palace to the Queen to perform the Office of the Kings Lieutenant, but ſo privatly, that never any did perceive it. This courſe of life continued a long time, but the King being a publick perſon could not ſo well diſſemble his love, and many honeſt men took great pity on the Gentleman; for the naughty boyes would make horns at him behind his back in ſign of Mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which he underſtood well enough, but this moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery was ſo pleaſing to him, that he as highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of his Horns, as of the Crown of the King, who one day his Wife being with him, could hardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves from laughing out-right, they both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the head of a Stagg which was nailed up in the Houſe of the Gentleman, the King ſaid the head was very ſuitable in that place. The Gentleman who had as good a heart as himſelf, preſently after the Kings departure did write upon the head, <hi>To porto le corna, chi aſcundo vede ma talle porta chi nolo crede.</hi> The King not long afterwards returning to his houſe, did obſerve the writing on the head of the Stagg, and demanded of the Gentleman the reaſon of it, who made anſwer unto him, If the ſecret of the King be concealed to the Stagg, I ſee no reaſon that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Stagg ſhould be declared to the King; But you may content your ſelf he ſaid, that thoſe who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119929:25"/>horns do not all ſhow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beaming forth from their head, for ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſo pleaſant that they will not unbonnet any Man, and he doth bear them lighteſt, who thinketh that he hath none at all. The King un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by theſe words well enough that he knew ſomething of his own affairs, but never ſuſpected the love between the Queen and himſelf; for the Queen ſeemed to be the more contented with the life of her Husband; wherefore they lived a long time in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity both on the one ſide, and on the other, untill that old age did put a period to it.</p>

True it is, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this diſcourſe one of the Ladies in the Company began to laugh out-right, knowing that ſhe who took up</hi> Saffre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>for theſe words, was not ſo well beloved by him, as that for her ſake he would ſuffer either horns, or ſhame, or damage.

               <head type="sub">The fourth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN <hi>Flanders</hi> there was a Lady of ſo good a Houſe that the could not be of a better; ſhe was a Widdow, and had had two Husbands, but no children by them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. During her widdo whood ſhe lived privately in her Brothers Houſe, by whom ſhe was very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, who was a great Lord, and Husband to one of the Daughters of the King. This young Prince was much addicted to his pleaſures, hunting, hawking, and other paſtimes, and to the Company of Ladies, and ſuch ſports as youth is prone unto: He had a very perverſe Lady to his Wife, to whom the Paſtimes of her Husband were no way pleaſing; whereupon he took his Siſter to live with him, who was of a merry heart, and the beſt Company that could be, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe very wiſe and provident. There was in the houſe of this Lord a Gentleman, whoſe Greatneſs, Bounty, and ſweetneſſe of Diſpoſition, did ſurpaſſe all his Companions. This Gentleman ſeeing the Siſter of his Maſter to be alwayes merry, and of a lively diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, did reſolve with himſelf that he would try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor the propoſitions of an honeſt Friend would be diſpleaſing to her, or no, which he did accordingly, but received from her an anſwer quite contrary to her countenance; and although her anſwer was ſuch as became a Princeſſe, and a Lady of unqueſtionable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet ſeeing him ſo lovely, and in other things ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119929:26"/>noble, ſhe eaſily pardoned his boldneſſe, and told him, that ſhe would not be diſpleaſed as often as he ſhould ſpeak unto her, but deſired him to make no more words concerning ſuch a purpoſe, which he promiſed to doe, being afraid to loſe the happineſſe and the honour to converſe with her. Nevertheleſſe at laſt, his affection did ſo encreaſe, that he forgot the promiſe which he had made unto her, not that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to court her any more with words, for he had too often to his experience found the wiſe and grave anſwers which ſhe gave him, but he conceived with himſelf, that if he could get her at a place of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that ſhe who was a Widdow, young, luſty, and of an excellent complexion, might poſſibly take ſome pity on him, and on her ſelf alſo. To arrive to this end, he told his Maſter that he had neer to his own houſe a very fair Chace, and if he pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair thither to kill three or four Bucks in the month of <hi>May,</hi> he could not ſee better ſport. The Lord as well for the love he did bear unto the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as for the pleaſure of the Chace, did grant him his requeſt, and did go along with him to his houſe, which was a very fair one, and in good order, he being the richeſt Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was in that Country. He lodged the Lord and his Lady in one body of the houſe, and, over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, her whom he loved better than himſelf. The Chamber was ſo well hung with <hi>Arras,</hi> and ſo well matted, that it was impoſſible to perceive the trap-door which he had made betwixt the Bed and the Wall, which deſcended into that Room where his Mother lay, who was an antient Lady, and troubled with a weakneſſe in her eyes, and becauſe ſhe had the cough being afraid to diſturb the Lady who lay above her, ſhe changed her chamber for that of her Sons, and every evening that old woma did carry Confects to the Lady for her Collation, in which ſervice this Gent did aſſiſt her, who (being much beloved by her Brother, and of his moſt privat counſels) was not refuſed to be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119929:27"/>preſent every morning at the Princeſſes and at her riſing up, and every night at their lying down, where he ſaw daily an occaſion to augment his affection. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that one Evening having kept this Lady up ſo late, that ſleep ſeizing on her eys did force him from her Chamber, he retired to his own, and when he had taken the moſt gorgeous and perfumed ſhirt that he had, and a night cap ſo well accoutred that nothing could be wanting to it, looking in his glaſs he thought unto himſelf that there was no Lady in the world who could refuſe ſo lovely, gallant, and ſo proper a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage. Wherefore promiſing to himſelf a happy iſſue of his Enterpriſe, he repaired to his bed, where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make but a ſhort ſtay, for the deſire and the hope he entertained to poſſeſſe a place in one more honourable and pleaſant; As ſoon as he had ſent forth all his people, he did ariſe to ſhut the door after them, and a long time did liſten if in the Chamber of the Lady, which was directly above his own, he could hear any noiſe, and when he could aſſure himſelf that all was quiet, he began his ſweet travels, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees opening the trap-door, which was ſo fitly made and covered with cloath, that it made not the leaſt crack, he went up into the Ladies Chamber between the bed and the wall, and without any regard to the obligation which he made her, nor to the illuſtrious family of which ſhe was deſcended, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding any leave, or making reverence to her, he lay down cloſe unto her, who ſooner found her ſelf in his arms, then perceived his comming. But ſhe being a luſty woman did wreſt her ſelf out of his arms, and asking him who he was, began to ſtrike, and bite, and ſcratch him, inſomuch that he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for fear ſhe ſhould cry out, to ſtop her mouth with the coverlet, which was impoſſible for him to doe; for when ſhe ſaw that he ſpared nothing of all his ſtrength to procure her ſhame, ſhe ſpared nothing of her own to defend her ſelf, and as lowd as ſhe could ſhe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for her Lady of Honour, an antient and wiſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119929:27"/>Woman who lay in her Chamber, who preſently in her Smock made haſt unto her Miſtreſſe; when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman found that he was diſcovered, he had ſo great a fear to be known who he was, that as faſt as he could he went down the ſame way he came up, and as great as his hope was before, and deſire to be entertained, ſo great a grief and deſpair poſſeſſed him to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf return'd in that ſad condition. He found his Glaſſe and the Candle upon the table, and looking on his face bleeding with the ſcratches which ſhe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, and the blood dropping on his ſhort, which had diſcoloured the gold, he began to ſay, O beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou haſt now well rewarded me according to my merit, for through thy vain promiſes I have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a thing which is impoſſible, and which it may be inſtead of augmenting my contentments may be the doubling of all my ſorrows, being aſſured, that if ſhe ſhould know that againſt the promiſe I have made her I have enterpriſed this folly, I ſhould loſe all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and familiar frequentation, which no man hath with her more than my ſelf. To gain the love of her heart, I ſhould not by force have attempted to have ſurprized her fair body, but by my ſervice and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patience have attended, untill that Love became victorious; for without it all the virtue and force of Man have no power at all. In this manner he paſſed away the night in complaints, tears, and ſighs, which cannot be number'd. In the Morning, beholding his face ſo torn, he counterfeited that he was ſick, and not able to endure the light, untill the Princes were gone from his Houſe. The Lady who remained vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, being confident that there was not a man in her Brothers Court who durſt have attempted ſo lewd an enterpriſe, but he only who aſſumed the boldneſſe to declare his love unto her, did aſſure her ſelf that it was he who endeavoured ſo much to work her ſhame, and with her Lady of Honor ſought every place and corner of the Chamber to find which way it could be, and when ſhe could not diſcover any
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:119929:28"/>thing ſhe ſpoke unto her in a great choler; Aſſure your ſelf, that it can be no other but the Maſter of the houſe, and in the morning I will make ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to my Brother of him, that his head ſhall be the witneſſe of my Chaſtity. Her Lady of Honour ſeeing her in this reſolution, ſpake unto her, Madam, I am very ſenſible of the Love which you have unto your Honor, to increaſe which you will not ſpare the life of one who hath too much hazarded it through the force of that love he bears you, but oftentimes we think to increaſe that which we diminiſh; Wherefore I beſeech you, Madam, that you would vouchſafe to repreſent unto me the truth of the fact; and when the Lady had given her an account of it all along, her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Honor ſaid unto her, You aſſure me then that he received nothing but blows and ſcratches from you. The Lady made anſwer, Nothing elſe I dare aſſure you; and if he meet not with a good Chirurgion, I do beleeve that on to morrow the marks will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent. Madam, ſince it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>slo, ſaid her Lady of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, it ſeems to me that you have more occaſion to praiſe God, than to reſolve with you ſelf to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of him; for you ought to beleeve, ſince he hath ſo great a heart to make ſuch an enterpriſe, the deſpite he hath to have failed in it, is more grievous to him than any Death that you can give him. If you deſire to be revenged on him, let him alone to Love, and Shame, which know better how to torment him than you, or any Inſtigations of your Honor. Take heed, Madam, to fall into an Inconvenience, ſuch as is his own; for inſtead of enjoying the greateſt pleaſure that poſſibly he could deſire, he hath received the greateſt ſhame that poſſibly a Gentleman can indure. So you, Madam, thinking to increaſe your Honour, do go the next way to diminiſh it. For if you will make a complaint, you will make that publick, which now no Man knows, for you may be ſure that for his part he will not reveal it unto any. And whe <hi>Monſieur</hi> your Brother ſhall perform that Juſtice which you demand,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119929:28"/>and the poor Gentleman ſhall come to ſuffer death, the Report will run, that he would have to doe with you according to his pleaſure, and the greateſt part will ſay, That it is a ſtrange thing for a Gentleman to make ſuch an enterpriſe, if the Lady had not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him ſome great occaſion her ſelf. You are fair and young, and merry in all Company, there is not any in this Court who doth not obſerve the daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of Love which you vouchſafe this Gentleman you ſuſpect; who will not judge, that if he hath made ſuch an attempt, it is not without ſome fault on your ſide? And your Honour, which untill now hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways gone with an advanced head, ſhall be diſputed of in every place where this ſtory ſhall be repeated. The Lady underſtanding the good reaſons of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Honour, did apprehend that ſhe ſpake the truth, and that juſtly ſhe ſhould be blamed, eſpecially by reaſon of the familiar love that ſhe was pleaſed to ſhew unto him: She therefore demanded of her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Honour, what ſhe ſhould do? who ſaid unto her, Madam, ſince you are pleaſed to receive my counſell, and do obſerve the affection from whence it comes, it ſeems to me, that you ought to entertain a perfect joy in your heart, that the moſt handſom and moſt accompliſhed Gentleman that I have ſeen, knew neither by love nor force to diſpoſſeſſe you of your Chaſtity. And for this, Madam, you ought to humble your ſelf before God, and to acknowledge that this is not by your virtue; for many great Ladies who have led a life more auſtere than your ſelf, have been humbled by Men leſſe worthy to be loved than himſelf. And moreover, you ought to take heed to entertain no more diſcourſes of love with him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are too many who the ſecond time have fallen into dangers, which they bad avoided the firſt. Madam, remember that love is blind, and blinds us in ſuch a manner, that when we think the path moſt ſure, it is oftentimes moſt ſlippery.</p>
               <p>And, Madam, it ſeems to me, that you ought not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119929:29"/>to make the leaſt ſhow of what in this caſe hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to you, either to himſelf or to any other; and if he ſhall yet ſpeak any thing to you concerning it, do you pretend that you know nothing at all, to avoyd two dangers, the one of the vain glory of the victory you have obtained, the other in taking pleaſure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering things ſo pleaſant to the fleſh; ſome the moſt chaſte have enough to do to keep themſelves from feeling ſome heats thereof, although they fly from the temptations as faſt as poſſibly they can. And to the end Madam that he might not think by this hazard, that he hath done ſomething which may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to you, I ſhall adviſe you, that by degrees you will remove your ſelf and your accuſtomed familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes from him, to the end he might underſtand how much you deſpiſe his follies, and how great your goodneſſe is, which is contented with the victory which God hath given you, without demanding any venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on him: And, Madam, God give you the grace to continue the honeſty which he hath put in your heart, and underſtanding that all bleſſings come from him, to love and ſerve him better than you have been accuſtomed to do. The Lady intended to put in practice the counſell of her Lady of Honour, and ſlept with as much comfort, as the Gentleman did keep himſelf awake with ſadneſs. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Lord prepared to be gone, and asked for the Gentleman, it was told him, that he was ſtruck with ſo ſudden a ſickneſſe that he could not endure to ſee the light, nor any Man to ſpeak to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Prince was very ſorry, and would have gone to ſee him, but being informed that he was aſleep, he was unwilling to awake him, and without ſaying <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu</hi> unto him he departed from his houſe, taking his Wife and Siſter with him, who underſtanding the excuſes of the Gentleman not to ſee the Prince nor the Company at his departure, did hold her ſelf aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it was ſhe who had brought this dangerous Indiſpoſition on him; becauſe he duiſt not ſhew the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119929:29"/>marks which ſhe had given him. And although his Maſter the Prince ſent often to him to come to Court, yet he would not return untill he were well healed of all his hurts, but only that which Love &amp; Deſpite had printed in his heart. When he was returned to Court, and found himſelf before his victorious Enemy, it was not without bluſhing on her part, and he who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be the moſt ſpiritfull in all the Court, was ſo amazed, that oftentimes before her he held down his head; wherefore ſhe was fully aſſured that her former ſuſpition was true, and by little and little ſhe eſtranged her ſelf from him, though not ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he perceived it well enough; but he durſt take no notice of it, for fear of ſuffering worſe, and kept afterwards that love of his concealed in his heart with that patience of Reſtraint as he deſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, Here you may behold what ought to give a great fear to thoſe who preſume on that which pertains not to them, and it ought to be an example of incouragement to Ladies to behold the virtue of this young Lady, and the good Counſel of her Lady of honour. If any one of you ſhall chance to be in the like condition, the remedy is already given. It ſeems to me, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that the Gentleman of whom you have ſpoken had ſo faint a heart that he was not worthy of that Lady, for having ſuch an opportunity, he ought not either for young or old to let fall his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe; And I might well ſay that his Heart was not full of Love, ſince the fear of death and ſhame found ſo much room therein.</hi> Nomerfide <hi>replyed unto him, what would you have the poor Gentleman do, ſeeing he had two women againſt him? Do? ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>why he ought to have killed the old one, and when the young one was with him alone, ſhe had been half overcome.</hi>

The Friers did ſwear unto her by their St. <hi>Francis</hi> that ſhe ſhould not ask that thing which they would not perform to have that of her which they deſired. In the firſt place I require of you ſaid ſhe, that you ſwear and promiſe to me, that neither of you will declare, what ſhall be done, to any man living, to which moſt willingly they did ſwear. Secondly, I require of you, that one of you after another will take his pleaſure of me, for I have too much modeſty that you ſhould ſee me both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore make choice which of you will take me firſt. They ſound this requeſt very juſt, and the younger of them did conſent that he who was the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould begin; and drawing near to a little I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhe ſaid to the younger Frier ſtay here and ſay your Oriſons until I have carried your Companion into yonder Iland; if at his return he do commend me to you, we will leave him here, and you and I will goe together; whereupon the younger of the Friers leaped into the Iland, where he attended the return of his companion, whom the Ferrywoman did row into another Iland, and when ſhe came to it, ſhe made a pretence as if ſhe would have made faſt her boat, and ſaid unto him; My friend, Look in what place we ſhall be, whereupon the Frier entred upon the Iland to find out ſome corner that might ſeem for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him on land, with one of her feet againſt a Tree ſhe thruſt back the boat, which preſently retired into the River, and left the two Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the two deſarts, and cryed out unto them as loud: ſhe could, My friends, attend until the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of God ſhall come to comfort you, for this day you are like to have nothing of me that ſhall do it. The two poor Friers, finding the deceit fell both upon their knees upon the banks of the River, beſeeching her that ſhe would not put them to that ſhame, and aſſured her that if ſhe would gently waft them to the place where they were to land, they would demand
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119929:31"/>nothing of her. But ſhe rowing on did ſay unto them, I ſhould be a fool, having eſcaped your hands, if I ſhould put my ſelf again into them, and returning to the village ſhe called her husband and thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the judicature, to come and ſurpriſe thoſe inraged wolfs, whoſe teeth by the grace of God ſhe had eſcaped, who went along with her ſo well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied that neither great nor ſmal would ſtay behind, but would all partake in the pleaſure of this ſport. The poor Friers, ſeeing ſo great a company comming, did hide themſeves in the Ilands, as ſometimes <hi>Adam</hi> did from the face of God. Their ſhame did ſet their ſins before their eyes, and the fear of being puniſhed did make them greatly to tremble as if they were more than half dead, but that did not ſave them from being apprehended and led away priſoners, which was not without being mocked and hooted at both by men and women; Some ſaid, theſe godly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do preach chaſtity unto us, and yet would take away our wives from us; Her Husband ſaid, they will not touch ſilver with a naked hand, but will handle the thighs of our wives which are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; Others ſaid, they are Sepulchers, white without, and within full of rottenneſſe; and ſome cryed out, by their fruits you may know what trees they are.</p>

He was no ſooner departed, but his Wife ſent to her Friend to acquaint him with it, who was not with her above half an hour, but, behold, her Husband was returned, and knocked aloud at the Gate. She who knew him, told her Friend of it, who was ſo amazed, and put into ſuch a fright, that he could wiſh himſelf again in the belly of his Mother, and curſed both her and her love who had brought him into ſo much danger; but ſhe aſſured him, that he needed not trouble himſelf, for ſhe would find a means to get him ſafe forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, and without the leaſt diſgrace, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to put on his cloaths with what ſpeed he could.

               <p>IN the County of <hi>Albez</hi> there was a man named <hi>Borner,</hi> who had eſpouſed a virtuous Woman, and of good fortunes, whoſe honour and reputation he did much cheriſh, as all men there are moſt tender of their Wives; and although he would have his Wife to preſerve her Loyalty to him, yet he would not that the ſame law ſhould be equally obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them both; for he fell in love with his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid, in the change of whom for his Wife he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing but that diverſity of Viands would not be agreeable.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119929:35"/>that unto hm which ſhe ſo much doubted of; wherefore ſhe ſaid unto her, Be content good Wench, and by little and little entertain my Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band with good words and promiſes, and afterwards you may aſſign him the place to be privat with you in my Wardrobe, but do not fail to acquaint me with the night in which he is to come, and have a care that you tell no body of it. The Chamber-maid did accordingly as her Miſtreſſe did command her, of which her Maſter was ſo glad, that he repaired to his Companion, to tell him what a Feaſt he was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, who intreated him, that when he was gone he might take what he left. This being agreed upon, and the hour come, the Maſter made all the haſt he could to be with his Chambermaid, as he thought, but his Wife, who at that preſent had renounced the Authority to Command, for the Pleaſure to Serve, had placed her ſelf in her room, and received her Husband, not as a marryed woman, but feigned the countenance of a ſtriving and an aſtoniſhed Girl, and did deport her ſelf ſo well, that her Husband did not perceive her. I cannot repreſent unto you which of theſe two thought themſelves the moſt happy, either the Husband, who thought he had deceived his Wife, or the Wife, who had deceived her Husband; who when he had continued with her, not according to his deſire, but according to his power, (for he was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Married Man) he departed from her, and found his Companion far more young and luſty than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and told him in a great joy, That he had found in the Wardrobe one of the beſt Robes that ever he did ſee: His Companion made anſwer to him, You know the promiſe made betwixt us? Go then quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid the Maſter, for fear ſhe may riſe of her ſelf, or my Wife having need of her may call her. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion did repair immediatly to her, and found there the ſelf-ſame Chambermaid whom the Husband had miſtook, who thinking him to be her own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, did not refuſe unto him the thing which he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:119929:36"/>demanded. I underſtand here to <hi>Demand</hi> for to <hi>Take,</hi> for he durſt not ſpeak unto her. He continued with her far longer than her Husband, which made the Woman much to marvell, for ſhe was not accuſtomed to have ſuch night-work; howſoever ſhe had pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, comforting her ſelf with the Lecture which ſhe reſolved to read unto her Husband on the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and at the mocks which he ſhould receive from her. About the break of day the Man did riſe from her, and going out of the bed, being frolick with her, he took from her the Ring which ſhe did wear on her Thumb, with which her Husband had eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her; a thing which the Women of that Countrey do preſerve with great ſuperſtition; and do much honour the Women who keep the ſaid Ring to their Deaths; And on the contrary; if by Misfortune they do loſe it, they are diſ-eſteem'd, as having given their Faith to another beſides their Husbands. She was highly contented that he took it from her, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to her ſelf; That it would be a moſt ſure witneſſe to him of the trick ſhe had put upon him. When the Companion was returned to the Maſter, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, And well! How is it? He made anſwer to him, That he was of his opinion, and if he had not feared the approach of the day, he had ſtill continued with her; And thus they went afterwards both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to take their reſt as patiently as they could. In the morning as they were dreſſing themſelves, the Husband obſerved the Ring which his Companion had on his finger, as like as could he unto that which on his Mariage he gave unto his Wife: When he underſtood by him that he had taken it from the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his Chambermaid; he was much amazed, and began to beat his head againſt the walls, and to cry out, O the Virtue of God! I have made a Cuckold of my ſelf, my ſelf knowing nothing at all. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, his Companion ſaid unto him, It may be in the Evening your Wife gave it her to lay up for her. The Husband repaired ſtraight to his Houſe, where
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:119929:36"/>he found his Wife, more lovely to look on, more gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous in her apparell, and more joyfull of heart than ſhe was accuſtomed to be, as both rejoycing to have ſaved the conſcience of her Chambermaid, and to have made triall to the utmoſt what her Husband was able to perform, without loſing any thing but the ſleep of one night. Her Husband ſeeing her with ſo glad a Countenance, ſaid to himſelf, If ſhe knew her good Fortune ſhe would not make me ſo welcom; and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to her of divers ſubjects he took her by the hand, and obſerved that ſhe had not that Ring on her finger, which never before came off it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was like a man altogether tranſported, and demanded of her in a trembling voice, What have you done with your Ring? She being glad that he had begun the ſubject on which ſhe deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Diſcourſe, ſaid unto him, O you moſt wicked amongſt Men! from whom do you think that you had taken, it? You do believe confidently enough that it was from my Chambermaid, for the love of whom you have expended twice as much of your goods, and more than ever you have beſtowed on me. The laſt night on the firſt time that you came to lie with her, I judged you ſo greedy and amorous of her that it was impoſſible to be more, but after that you were gone away &amp; ſuddenly return'd again, it ſeem'd to me that you were a very Devil without either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or meaſure. Fond and wicked as you are I think with your ſelf what a blindneſſe did poſſeſſe you, ſo much to praiſe my body and my plumpneſſe, with which ſo many years you have had your ſport without making any great eſteem of it. It was not the beauty, nor the delicious plumpneſſe of your Chambermaid which you found ſo agreeable to you, but an infamous ſin, and a reprobate concupiſcence, which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame your heart, and did render your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo dull, that into that fury in which luſt had thrown you in your deſire of your Chamber-maid, I doe believe that you would have taken a ſhe goat
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:119929:37"/>a coif on her head for a handſome maid. It is now time my Husband to correct your ſelf, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rented with me, acknowledging me to be yours, and a woman of integrity, and to conſider what you have done, thinking that I am a poor well-meaning crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That which I have done hath been to retire and withdraw you from your misfortunes, that in our age we may live together in love and quiet of Conſcience. For if you will continue in your paſſed courſe of life, I had rather ſeparate my ſelf from you than from day to day to ſee before my eyes the ruine of your Soul, your Body, and your Fortunes. But if you pleaſe to acknowledge your errors, and reſolve with your ſelf to live according to the will of God, and to follow his Commandements, I will forget all your former faults, as I beſeech God to forget my Ingratitude that I love him not as I ought to do. Who was now amazed and on the brink of deſpair? it was the poor husband, to ſee that his wife, ſo lovely, chaſt and courteous, ſhould be forſaken by him for one who did not love him, and which is worſe, to be ſo unfortunate as to make her a ſinner without her knowledge, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to partake of that pleaſure which was only for himſelf; wherfore he bequeathed to himſelf the Horns of perpetual mockery. But obſerving that his wife was throughly mov'd at the love which he did bear to his Chamber-maid, he did forbear to acquaint her with the evil turn that he had done her, and asking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of her, he did faithfully promiſe to abandon all-together his idle courſe of life. This being done, he gave back unto her the Ring which he had taken from his Companion, whom he intreated not to reveal his ſhame to any. But as all things whiſpered in the car are preached upon the Houſe-top, ſo not long afterward the truth was known, and he was called Cuckold, without any diſgrace unto his wife.</p>

               <head>The Lamentable Death of a Gentleman in Love, who too late received comfort of her whom he affected.</head>
               <head type="sub">The ninth Novell.</head>
               <p>BEtween <hi>Dauphin</hi> and <hi>Provence</hi> there lived a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman more rich in virtue, beauty, and in courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, than in the goods of Fortune, who moſt intirely loved a young Gentlewoman, whoſe Name I will not rehearſe, in reſpect unto her Kinred, who are deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of good and great Families, but you may aſſure your ſelves that the Story is moſt true, and becauſe he was not deſcended of ſo great a houſe as ſhe was, he durſt not diſcover his affection to her; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme love which he did bear unto her was ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and perfect, that he did chuſe rather to die, than to deſire any one thing which might tend to her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor; and ſeeing himſelf in ſo low a condition, in compariſon of her, he could not entertain the leaſt hope to eſpouſe her. Wherefore his love was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119929:39"/>on no other end, but only with all his power to love her as perfectly as poſſibly he could, of which at laſt ſhe had ſome Intelligence. And ſeeing the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affection which he did bear unto her ſo full of virtue and civility, ſhe thought her ſelf happy to be beloved by ſo worthy a perſonage, and made ſo much of him, that he who could not have wiſhed for more, was greatly contented at it. But Malice the Enemy to all Quiet could not long ſuffer the continuance of a life ſo happy; For ſome Informers whiſpered in the Mothers, ear, That they much wondred that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was of ſuch power in her houſe, and that they ſuſpected the beauty of her Daughter to be the only occaſion of it, with whom they oftentimes obſerved him to hold diſcourſe. The Mother who no wayes doubted the honeſty of the Gentleman, of whom ſhe was as much aſſured as of any of her own Children, was very forry that there was ſpread abroad ſuch an uncharitable opinion of him, but fearing that ſome ſcandall might ariſe by the malice of bad tongues, ſhe intreated him at laſt, that for a certain time he would not come ſo often to her houſe as he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to do. This was hard of digeſtion to him, knowing that the civil diſcourſe which he held al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with her Daughter, did not deſerve that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint. Nevertheleſſe, to ſtop the report of all ill tongues, he retired for a time, untill that report was ſilenced, &amp; afterwards returned, as he had been accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to do. His abſence had no ways diminiſhed his affection; Being in the houſe, he underſtood that the young Lady was to be married to a Gentleman, who in his opinion was not of that great Eſtate, but that his own ſervice might be as well entertained, and be as acceptable as his. He therefore began to take heart to imploy his friends to ſpeak on his behalf, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that if the choice were offered to the young Lady, that ſhe would prefer him unto the other: Nevertheleſſe the Mother of the Daughter, and her Kinred, did make choice of the other, becauſe he was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119929:39"/>far more rich; whereat the Gentleman was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly melancholly, knowing that his Miſtreſſe would loſe thereby as much contentment as himſelf. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by little and little, without any other Sickneſſe, he did begin to conſume away, and in a ſhort time was ſo much changed, that it ſeemed he had covered the beauty of his countenance with the Mask of Death, to which day ſucceeding day, and hour fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing hour, he did joyfully repair. So it was, that he could not ſometimes forbear from ſpeaking to her whom he loved ſo intirely. But at laſt his ſtrength failed him, and he was inforced to keep his Bed, of which he would not adviſe her whom he loved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was unwilling that ſhe ſhould partake in his affliction. And ſuffering himſelf to ſink into deſpair, he at laſt could neither eat, nor drink, nor ſleep, nor take any reſt; inſomuch that it was impoſſible to know him, by reaſon of his leaneneſſe, and the ſtrange and ſharp countenance which he had. Some there were, who advertiſed the Mother of his Miſtreſſe of it, who was a Woman full of pity, and loved the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman ſo well, that if all her Kinred and Confidents had been of the ſame opinion as her ſelf was, and her Daughter, they had preferred his Honeſty and fair Deportment, above all the Fortunes of the other; but the Kinred who were on the Fathers ſide would not underſtand it: Nevertheleſſe ſhe reſorted with her Daughter to viſit the poor Gentleman, whom they found rather dead than alive; And perceiving that the end of his life did approach, he ſent for the Prieſt, and having made his Confeſſion, he received the holy Sacrament, thinking to have died without ſeeing any one. But being ready to deſcend unto the ſleep of Death, and unexpectedly beholding her who was both his Life and Reſurrection, he found himſelf ſo fortified, that he did ariſe up in his Bed, and ſaid unto the old Lady; Some occaſion hath brought you hith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Madam, to give a viſit unto him who hath already one foot in his Grave, and of whoſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119929:40"/>Death you are the occaſion. The Lady made anſwer, How can that be poſſible, that he whom we do love ſo well can receive his Death by our neglect? Tell me, I pray you, upon what account of Reaſon do you ſpeak theſe words? Madam, ſaid he, Although as much as it was poſſible for me, I have diſſembled the love which I moſt faithfully have born unto <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle</hi> your Daughter, ſo it is, that my friends (ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Marriage betwixt her and me) have been more hot upon it than I deſired, ſeeing thereby I have received this Misfortune to loſe all my hopes; neither doth it ſo much afflict me for my particular, but for that I am confident ſhe can never be ſo well intreated by any other, nor will be ſo well beloved as by me. The obſervation which I make, that ſhe ſhall loſe the moſt beſt, and moſt affectionate friend and ſervant that ſhe hath in the world, doth more afflict me than the loſſe of my own life, which onely for her alone I would preſerve; but becauſe I find it cannot be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable any wayes unto her, it is a gain unto me to loſe it. The Mother and the Daughter hearing theſe words, did do the beſt they could to comfort him. The Mother ſaid unto him, Take courage my Friend, and I promiſe you upon my faith, that if God ſhall reſtore you unto your health, my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall have no other Husband but your ſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſhe ſtands here before you, and I command her upon the obligation of her Duty to make the ſame promiſe to you. Her Daughter melting into tears, did the beſt that ſhe could to give him an aſſurance of that which her Mother had promiſed: But he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, that if he were recovered he ſhould not enjoy his Miſtreſſe, and that the good words that were given him, were onely by degrees to reſtore him unto his loſt health, did ſay unto them, That if theſe words had been ſpoken to him but three Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths agoe, he had been the moſt healthfull, and the moſt happy Man in all <hi>France,</hi> but this Relief came ſo late unto him, that it could neither be believed,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:119929:40"/>nor hoped. And when he obſerved that they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inforce a belief into him of what they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, he ſaid unto them; Since ſo faithfully you have promiſed that great happineſſe which can never arrive unto me, (though now your ſelves would have it ſo) by reaſon of the great weakneſſe in which I am, I ſhall crave a far leſſe favour, which as yet I have not had the boldneſſe to demand. Immediatly they did both ſwear unto him that it ſhould be performed, and deſired him with confidence to demand it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſaid unto the Mother of the young Lady, I do beſeech you that you would give her in my arms, whom you do promiſe ſhall be my Wife, and that you do command her to embrace and kiſſe me. The young Lady, who was not accuſtomed to ſuch famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities, did make ſome difficulty of it, but her Mother expreſly did command her, ſeeing he had loſt both the <hi>underſtanding</hi> and the <hi>force</hi> of a living Man. On that Command the Daughter did advance her ſelf upon the bed of the poor ſick Gentleman, and ſaid unto him, My old Friend, I pray you to be frolick: The poor Gentleman, ſanguiſhing in his extreme weakneſſe, ſtretched forth his arms, deſpoyled of fleſh and blood, and with all the force of his body embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Cauſe of his Death, and kiſſing her with his pale and cold lips, did hold her cloſe unto him as long as poſſibly he could, and ſaid unto her, The love which I have born unto you, hath been ſo great and virtuous, that, Mariage excepted, I never deſired of you any other happineſſe than what I now enjoy, for the event whereof, and in this poſſeſſion of it, I with joy ſhall commend my Spirit unto God, who being himſelf perfect love and charity, doth know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my love, and the honeſty of my deſires, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him, having now my deſires in my arms, that he would receive my Spirit into his arms. And ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe words he took her again into his arms, and with ſo much vehemence, that his weak heart could not endure the ſtrength of his love, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119929:41"/>immediately abandoned of all the faculties of life, for his Joy was ſo much dilated, that the ſeat of the Soul failed, which did fly to her Creator. And although the poor body continued a long time without li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And ſince (as I have heard it reported) the Husband that was given her (to take off from himſelf thoughts of melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) could never be entertained with any true joy or comfort of heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You may ſee here Gentlemen, what before you would not believe, by my words. This Example is ſufficient to make you confeſſe, that a true and perfect love being too long concealed or miſpriſed doth bring us as low as death. There is none of you who know not the friends and kinred both of the one ſide and the other, wherefore you need not to make any doubt of it, and there is no man who hath made experience of it but will believe.

I ſpeak not for my ſelf, nor for any man here that is married, for I have enough of a woman, or rather more than will ſerve my turn, but for thoſe only who are in neceſſity, who in my opinion are but fools to be in fear of thoſe whom
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119929:41"/>they ought to make afraid. Do you not obſerve the ſorrow which this young Lady ſuffer'd for her folly? for ſince ſhe imbraced a dead body (a thing repugnant to Nature) ſhe would not have refuſed his living body, if he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as great boldneſſe living, as dying be moved pitty. Nevertheleſse ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>The Gentleman in this made an excellent Remonſtrance of the love and civility he did bear her, for which he ſhall be commended throughout the whole world; for to find chaſtity in an amorous heart is a thing more divine than belonging unto man.

               <p>IN <hi>Aragon</hi> in the County of <hi>Arand,</hi> there was a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy who although very young was the widdow of the Count of <hi>Arand;</hi> ſhe had by him one Son, and a Daughter called <hi>Florinda.</hi> The ſaid Lady did bring up her Children in all virtues, and honourable exerciſes, which belong to Lords and Ladies; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that her houſe was accounted to be one of the moſt honourable in all <hi>Spain.</hi> She reſorted often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119929:42"/>to <hi>Toledo,</hi> where the King of <hi>Spain</hi> did keep his Court; and when ſhe came to <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> (which was not far from her own houſe) ſhe ſtayed long with the Queen, and was as highly eſteemed in her Court as any Lady could be. Upon a time, according to her cuſtome, repairing to the King, who was then in <hi>Sarragoſſa</hi> in his Caſtle of <hi>Iuiſſur,</hi> this Lady in her way paſſed by a village which belonged to the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> who ſtirred not from the frontires of <hi>Perpignan</hi> by reaſon of the great wars which were then betwixt the King of <hi>France</hi> and himſelf; but at that time there was peace, inſomuch that the Vice-roy with all his Captains were come to do reverence to the King. The Vice-roy underſtanding that the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> did paſſe through the Land of his Jurisdiction, did go to meet her, as well for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient love he did bear unto her, as for the honour of being a Kinſwoman of the Kings. The Vice-roy had in his company many gallant Gentlemen, who by the long exerciſe of their arms had acquired ſo much Fame and Honour, that thoſe thought themſelves happy that could ſee them, and enjoy their company. Amongſt others there was one called <hi>Amadour,</hi> who although he was not of above eighteen or nineteen years of age, had ſo aſſured a grace of Deportment, and ſo excellent an underſtanding, that amongſt a thouſand he was thought moſt worthy to govern a Kingdome. It is true, that his underſtanding was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſo great, and ſo ſweet a beauty, that there was not any ey which conveyd not down to the heart a more than ordinary pleaſure to behold him, and ſo excellent a diſcourſe did accompany his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite beauty, that it could not be known to which to give moſt honour, either to the gracefulneſſe of his beauty, or the excellency of his elocution. But that which made him moſt eſteemed, was his height of Courage, the fame whereof was increaſed by his youth, for in many places he made ſo many gallant demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of it, that not only <hi>Spain,</hi> but alſo <hi>France</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:119929:43"/>and <hi>Italy</hi> did highly eſteem his virtues, for in all the wars wherein ever he was, he was always prodigal of his blood, and proud of danger, and when his own Country was in peace, he did ſeek out Forein wars, and was beloved and eſteemed both by his Friends and Enemies. This Gentleman for the love of his Captain was now in this land, where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> was arrived; and beholding the beauty and gracefulneſſe of her Daughter, (who was not then twelve years of age) he thought with himſelf that ſhe was the moſt fair and moſt accompliſhed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ever he beheld, and if he could but obtain her favour, he ſhould be more ſatisfied than with all the pleaſures and profits that he might receive from any other. After he had a long time looked upon her, he determined with himſelf to love her, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever impoſſibility there was on the contrary, both in regard of the Illuſtrious Family from whence ſhe was deſcended, and the tenderneſſe of her age, which as yet could not underſtand his Courtſhip. Againſt theſe fears he fortiſied himſelf with hope, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to himſelf, that at the laſt, Time and Patience would bring a happy end unto his labours. From that time Gentle love (who without any other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion but freely by his own force had entred into the heart of <hi>Amadour</hi>) did promiſe him favour and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to arrive unto the end of his deſires; and to provide for the greateſt difficulties, which was the diſtance of the Country where he lived, and the ſmall occaſions he had to ſee <hi>Florinda,</hi> he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (but againſt the firſt reſolution he had taken) to marry one of the Ladies of <hi>Barcelona</hi> or of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> amongſt whom, by reaſon of the Wars, he was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, that he ſeemed rather to be a <hi>Catalonian</hi> than a <hi>Caſtilian,</hi> although he was born not far from <hi>Toledo,</hi> and was deſcended of a rich and honourable family, but becauſe he was but a younger Brother he had no great patrimonies to inherit: So it was that Love and Fortune ſeeing him abandoned of his Kinred,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119929:43"/>did determine to make a Maſter-piece of him, and by the means of his Virtues gave him that which the Laws of his Country did deny him. He was ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly experienced in the feats of War, and ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by all Lords and Princes that he oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed their gifts, which he never took any thought to demand. The Counteſſe of which I told you did come accordingly unto <hi>Sarragoſſa,</hi> and was magniſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently entertained by the King, and all the Court. The Governour of <hi>Catalonia</hi> came oftentimes to viſit her, and <hi>Amadour</hi> never failed to accompany him for the pleaſure he received to ſpeak unto <hi>Florinda.</hi> And that he might better underſtand himſelf, and what Company did frequent unto the houſe, he addreſſed himſelf to the daughter of an antient Cavalier, called <hi>Avanturade,</hi> who was one of the next neighbors. She from her Youth had been brought up with <hi>Florinda,</hi> inſomuch that ſhe knew all which was hidden in her heart. <hi>Amadour,</hi> as well for the honeſty he found in her, as for that ſhe had three thouſand Duckets to her portion, did reſolve to entertain her, as that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he would eſpouſe, to which ſhe did lend a willing ear; but becauſe he was but poor, and the Father of the Damfell rich, ſhe thought that he would never agree unto the Marriage, unleſſe it were by the means of the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand;</hi> Wherupon ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her ſelf to <hi>Florinda,</hi> and ſaid unto her.

Although <hi>Florinda</hi> was aſtoniſhed to ſee him without an Anſwer, ſhe did impute it rather to his baſhfulneſſe than to any force of Love, and departed from him without ſpeaking any more. <hi>Amadour</hi> obſerving the virtue which in ſuch a tenderneſſe of youth did begin to ſhow it ſelf in <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda,</hi> did ſay unto her whom he intended to make his Wife, Marvail not at all that I became as a dumb Man before <hi>Florinda,</hi> for her virtues and wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe hid in ſo young an age, did ſo amaze me, that I knew not what to ſay unto her; But <hi>Avanturade,</hi> I muſt beſeech you to inform me (for you know the Secrets of the Houſe) what Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen do frequent it; for they that know her, and do not love her, are either Stones or Beaſts. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanturade,</hi> who before did love <hi>Amadour</hi> better than any one in the world, could conceal nothing from him, and told him, That Madam <hi>Florinda</hi> was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all the world, but becauſe of the cuſtom of the Countrey, there were but few admitted to ſpeak unto her, and that as yet ſhe had not ſeen any that had made any profeſſion of love unto her, but only two young Princes of <hi>Spain,</hi> who deſired to eſpouſe her, one whereof was of the Houſe, and the Son of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Fortunate,</hi> and the other was the young Duke of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119929:44"/>
                  <hi>Cadouce.</hi> I pray you, ſaid <hi>Amadour,</hi> Tell me which of them do you think that ſhe loveth beſt; She is ſo wiſe, ſaid <hi>Avanturade,</hi> that ſhe profeſſeth, that ſhe hath no other will but that of her Mothers, but as far as we can judge, ſhe loveth the Son of the Infant <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,</hi> far better than the young Duke of <hi>Cadouce;</hi> And I eſteem you to be a man of that Judgement, that on this day if it pleaſe you, you may ſatisfie your ſelf therein, for the Son of the Infant <hi>Fortunate</hi> is brought up in this Court, and is one of the moſt lovely, and moſt abſolute young Princes in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: And if this Marriage ſhould be according to the opinion &amp; deſire of us Maids, he ſhould be ſure to have Madam <hi>Florinda,</hi> that we might ſee together the moſt gallant couple in the World. And you ought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that although they are both of them very yong, ſhe not being above twelve, and he fifteen years of age, yet it is three years ſince firſt their love began, And above all things, if you would obtain the favour of <hi>Florinda,</hi> I would adviſe you to be a Friend and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Infant <hi>Fortunate. Amadour</hi> was very glad to underſtand that <hi>Florinda</hi> loved any thing, hoping at laſt that he might gain the place, if not of a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, yet of her Servant, for he feared nothing in her virtue, but only that ſhe could not be induced to love. After this <hi>Amadour</hi> did altogether frequent the Lodgings of the Son of the Infant <hi>Fortunate,</hi> whoſe favour eaſily he obtained, for all the Paſtimes which the young Prince loved, <hi>Amadour</hi> knew how to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; and above all things he was moſt expert in the riding of great Horſes, and in all kind of weapons, and in other recreations and exerciſes which a young man ought to know. After this the War began in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and <hi>Amadour</hi> of neceſſity was to return with the Governor, which was not without great grief, for he had no longer the means nor opportunity to come into that place where he might behold <hi>Florinda,</hi> for which purpoſe he did ſpeak unto his Brother, who was the <hi>Major Domo</hi> in the Court of the Queen of

                  <hi>Spain,</hi> and told him of the entertainment he found in the Houſe of the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> and of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell <hi>Aventurade,</hi> deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing him, that in his abſence he would uſe his utmoſt endeavour, that the Marriage might ſuddenly be ſolemnized, and that he would imploy therein the Reputation of the King and Queen, and of all his friends. The Gentleman who loved his Brother, as well for his virtues, as for the contiguity of blood, did promiſe to perform the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt he was able, which he did accordingly: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the old and covetous Father of <hi>Avanturade</hi> did forget his nature to regard the virtues of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi> which the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> and above all the beautifull <hi>Florinda</hi> did ſet forth before his eyes: In the ſame manner alſo did the young Count of <hi>Arand,</hi> who as he did grow in age, did grow alſo in love with gallant and virtuous men. When the Marriage was accorded on, the <hi>Major Domo</hi> ſent to ſeek out his Brother, whiles the Truce laſted betwixt both the Kings. During this time, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> retired to <hi>Madrid,</hi> to avoid the contagion of the bad ait, which was in many places: And by the advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and the requeſt alſo of the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> he made the Marriage betwixt the Dutcheſſe <hi>Medina-Coeli,</hi> an Heireſſe, and the young Count of <hi>Arand,</hi> as well for the benefit and Union of both Houſes, as for the love he did bear to the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> and he commanded that that this Marriage ſhould be celebrated in the Caſtle of <hi>Madrid.</hi> At this Marriage <hi>Amadour</hi> was preſent, who followed his own ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he eſpouſed her, by whom he was better belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, than he did love; for he onely made this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage as a Coverture, and a means to frequent the place where his Soul inceſſantly did abide. After he was Married, he aſſumed that boldneſſe, and was ſo familiar in the Houſe of the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> that the Ladies had no more regard of him, than of one of the Gentlewomen of the Houſe: And although he was then but two and twenty years of age, he did
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119929:45"/>deport himſelf ſo diſcreetly, that the Counteſſe did communicate to him all her affairs, and commanded her Son and her Daughter to make much of him, and to take that counſell which he adviſed them. Having gained this high Eſteem, he did carry himſelf ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo cunningly, that even thoſe whom he loved did not know his affection. But <hi>Florinda</hi> loved the wife of <hi>Amadour</hi> more than any other, and was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with her, that ſhe concealed not from her her moſt private thoughts, and declared to her all tho love which ſhe did bear to the Son of the Infant <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;</hi> and ſhe who did hope to gain him intirely, did ſpeak of him inceſſantly, and on any Diſcourſe where mention was made of him, ſhe would with delight take hold of it, and a long time entertain it. <hi>Amadour</hi> after his Marriage with <hi>Avanturade,</hi> ſtayed not above one moneth with this Company, but was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to return to the War, where he continued above two years without ſeeing of his Wife, who kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with her with whom ſhe was brought up. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this time <hi>Amadour</hi> did often write unto her, but the greateſt part of his Letter was Commendations to <hi>Florinda. Avanturade</hi> did not fail to ſhow the Letters to <hi>Florinda,</hi> who returned him thanks for it, and ſometimes with her own hand would ſignifie as much unto him in the Letters which <hi>Avanturade</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, which was the occaſion that made her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band more carefull to write more often unto her. But in all this <hi>Florinda</hi> knew nothing, but only that ſhe loved and reſpected him as her own Brother. This was the Intercourſe of Letters betwixt <hi>Amadour</hi> and <hi>Avanturade;</hi> and <hi>Amadour,</hi> who in the ſpace of five years had hardly ſeen <hi>Florinda</hi> two whole moneths, yet nevertheleſſe his Love, in deſpite of abſence, did continually encreaſe. But now the time was come that he made a voyage to ſee his Wife, and found the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> a great way from the Court. For the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was gone to <hi>Vandeluſia,</hi> and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with him the young Count of <hi>Arand,</hi> who alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:119929:51"/>did begin to bear arms. His Mother the Counteſſe was retired to a Houſe of pleaſure which ſhe had upon the Frontires of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Navarre,</hi> ſhe was very joyfull to ſee <hi>Amadour</hi> returned, who almoſt for three years together had been abſent. He was very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com to them all, and the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that he ſhould be entertained as her own Son. As long as he was with her, ſhe declared to him the whole ſtate of her affairs, and committed the greateſt part of the Government of her Houſe to his diſcretion. He gained ſo great an eſtimation, that in all places thereof whereſoever he came, they ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the doors unto him, believing him to be ſo able and ſo wiſe a perſonage, that in all things they did put their confidence in him, as if in ſome Saint or Angel. <hi>Florinda,</hi> for the love which ſhe did bear to his Wife, and to himſelf, did give great reſpect unto him in all the places whereſoever ſhe did ſee him, not knowing any thing of his Intention, wherefore ſhe minded not what countenance ſhe gave him, for her heart felt not any heat of a violent paſſion, but onely ſhe received a great contentment when ſhe was near <hi>Amadour,</hi> and no other thought of love poſſeſſed her. <hi>Amadour</hi> to avoid the Judgement of thoſe who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in the looks of Lovers, in compariſon of others, was in a great perplexity: For when <hi>Florinda</hi> came familiarly to ſpeak unto him (as one who thought no hurt) the fire concealed in his heart did ſo violently inflame it, that do what he could, his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour would riſe in his checks, and the ſparkles of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire would fly from his eyes. And to the end that in their daily converſation it might not be diſcerned, he pretended to court a very fair Lady, called <hi>Paulina,</hi> a Lady who in her time was eſteemed ſo beautifull, that few men that ever ſaw her did eſcape her bonds. This <hi>Paulina</hi> underſtanding how well <hi>Amadour</hi> had depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and <hi>Perpignan,</hi> inſomuch that he was beloved by all the moſt beautifull and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Ladies of that Country, and above all by the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119929:51"/>Counteſſe of <hi>Palamons,</hi> who in beauty was eſteemed the chiefeſt in all <hi>Spain,</hi> told him, That ſhe much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed him, that after ſo many great fortunes he had married ſo ill-favoured a woman. <hi>Amadour</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending by thoſe words that ſhe had a deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy her own neceſſity, did entertain her with the beſt Language that poſſibly he could, thinking, by making her to beleeve a pretence, that ſhe ſhould ſerve to be a coverture for the truth; but ſhe being cunning and experienced in love, was not contented with words, but (conceiving to her ſelf that his heart was not ſatisfyed with her Love) ſhe doubted leſt he did not make her ſerve for a cloak only; whereupon ſhe did ſo cloſely obſerve him, that her eyes were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways faſtened upon his, but he did ſo well diſſemble it, that ſhe could not make any certain judgment of any thing, but only had an obſcure ſuſpition, which was a great torment to this Gentleman. But <hi>Florin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> (who was ignorant of all thoſe Jealouſies) did ſpeak oftentimes before <hi>Paulina</hi> ſo familiarly to <hi>Amadour,</hi> that he put himſelf to an extraordinary task, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his eys againſt his heart; And to prevent the falling into an Inconvenience, ſpeaking one day to <hi>Florinda,</hi> and leaning both upon the Window, he ſaid unto her, Madam, I beſeech you that you will be pleaſed to adviſe me, which is the beſt, to ſpeak, or to die; <hi>Florinda</hi> readily made anſwer to him, I ſhall alwayes adviſe my friends, that it is beſt to ſpeak, and not die; for a few words may be mended, but life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt, can never be recovered. You ſhall promiſe me then, ſaid <hi>Amadour;</hi> that you ſhall neither be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, nor be aſtoniſhed at the words I ſhall ſpeak, untill you ſhall underſtand the end for which I ſpeak them. She replyed to him, Speak what you pleaſe, for if you ſhall aſtoniſh me, no man elſe ſhall recover me to my ſenſes, I aſſure you. He then began to ſpeak, Madam, I have not yet expreſſed unto you the great affection which I bear you, for two Reaſons: Firſt, That I intended by my long ſervice to give
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:119929:52"/>you an experience of it: and Secondly, becauſe I doubted you would conceive it to be an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble arrogance to addreſſe my ſelf unto you, who, were I a Prince as your ſelf, yet the loyalty of your heart would not ſuffer any other but he who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion of it, the Son of the Infant <hi>Fortunate,</hi> to hold any diſcourſe of Love with you. But Madam, as in great wars Neceſſity doth conſtrain us to make a waſt of our own goods, and oftentimes to ſpoil the Corn in the blade, that the Enemy may make no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it; ſo have I made an adventure to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the fruit which in time I did hope to gather, that neither your nor my Enemies might make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves any profit by our Damage. Underſtand Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that ſince you were ſcarce twelve years of age, I have been ſo devoted to your ſervice, that I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſed from ſearching out the means to obtain your favour, and for that occaſion, I married her whom I thought that you loved beſt; And underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the love which you bear to the Son of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Fortunate,</hi> I have endeavoured to ſerve and honour him, as you have ſeen. And whatſoever I thought would be pleaſing to you, I have ſought it with all my power; you ſee, How I have procured the good opinion of the Counteſs your Mother, of the Count your Brother, and of all thoſe whom you doe love, in a manner, that in this houſe I am not taken ſo much to be a Servant, as a Child, and all the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel that for theſe five years I have undertaken, hath been to live all the remainder of my life with you. And you muſt underſtand, that I am none of thoſe who by this means preſume to enjoy any pleaſure or profit by you, but what ſhall be virtuous. I know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and am confident, that I can never marry you, and if I could, I would not do the leaſt Injury to the love which you bear to him, whom I deſire to ſee your Husband. To proſecute you with a vicious love, as thoſe, who hope for ſome recompence for their ſervice, by the diſhonor of their Miſtreſſes, I
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119929:52"/>am ſo far from that, that I had rather ſee you dead, than to know you leſſe worthy to be beloved, or that virtue was abated in you, for any pleaſure that could arive to me. For the end and recompence of all my ſervice, I doe deſire only but one thing, which is, that you will be ſo conſtant a Miſtreſs to me, that you will never remove me from your favours, and continue me in the degree in the which I am, repoſing more confidence in me, than in any other; and having this aſſurance, that if for your honour, or any thing that doth concern you, you ſhall need the life of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, mine ſhall be imployed with all my heart for you. In like manner, that all honeſt and virtuous things that I ſhall doe, ſhall be done onely for the love of you: And if for Ladies of a far lower condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than your ſelf, I have performed deeds that have highly been eſteemed, be you aſſured, that for ſuch a Miſtreſſe my enterprizes ſhall be doubled; ſo that thoſe things which before I left off, as difficult, and impoſſible, ſhall now become eaſie to me. But if you will not accept me to be altogether yours, I have reſolved with my ſelf to leave off the Exerciſe of Arms, and to bid Adieu to Virtue, that hath not hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped me at my need. Wherefore, Madam, I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech you, that my juſt ſute may be granted to me, which neither your Honor nor your Conſcience can deny. The young Lady hearing thoſe words ſo unuſuall to her, did begin to change her colour, and held down her eyes, as a Woman aſtoniſhed: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever being of a ready, and a great underſtanding, ſhe ſaid unto him, Since it is ſo, Seignior <hi>Amadour,</hi> that you demand that of me which you have already, how doth it come about that you have made unto me ſo long an Oration? I have ſo great a fear, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your honeſt words there are ſome ill Intentions hid to deceive the Ignorance of my youth, that I am in a great perplexity to anſwer you. For if I ſhould deny that honeſt love which you offer me, I ſhould do contrary to that which hitherto I have done, who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119929:53"/>do put more confidence in your ſelf, than in all the Men in the world. Neither my Conſcience nor my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor do contradict your Demand, nor the love which I do bear to the ſon of the Infant <hi>Fortunate;</hi> for that love is grounded upon Marriage, to which you can have no pretence. I know nothing that may withhold me from giving you an anſwer according to your deſire, but onely Fear which invades my heart, grounded on the ſmall occaſion you have to begin this Diſcourſe: for if you have already that which you demand, what is it doth conſtrain you to ſpeak ſo affectionatly? <hi>Amadour,</hi> who now was not without an anſwer, ſaid unto her, Madam, you ſpeak moſt wiſely, and do me ſo much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the Confidence which you ſay you repoſe in me, that if I ſhould not content my ſelf with this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, I ſhould be unworthy of any other: But you are to underſtand Madam, that he who would raiſe a laſting edifice, ought to regard that he doth lay a ſure foundation; therefore I who deſire to continue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually in your ſervice, do not only look upon the means to keep me near unto you, but alſo to hinder what I can that the great affection which I bear unto you may not be diſcovered. For though it be ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that the leaſt ſin cannot be found in it, yet ſo it is, that thoſe who know not the hearts of true lovers, do oftentimes judge againſt the truth; and from hence proceed ſo many ill reports, the events whereof have been ſo miſchievous. The cauſe which hath enforced me to ſpeak, and to declare this unto you, is <hi>Paulina,</hi> who doth ſo ſtrongly ſuſpect me, perceiving in her own heart that I cannot love her, that in all places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I do come, ſhe is alwayes with a watchfull eye looking ſtedfaſtly on my face; and when you come to ſpeak familiarly unto me before her, I have ſo great a fear to give ſome ſign by which ſhe might ground ſome bad conſtruction, that I am ready to fall into an Inconvenience, from which I would fain keep my ſelf; ſo that I have conceived it expedient to beſeech you, That before her, and ſuch creatures as ſhe is, you
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119929:53"/>would not be pleaſed to ſpeak ſo ſuddenly unto me, for I had rather by far be out of the world, than any one alive ſhould have the leaſt knowledge of it; And were it not for the love which I owe unto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I ſhould not have taken this reſolution to ſpeak theſe words unto you; for I am ſufficiently happy in the love and confidence you have in me, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding any thing more, but onely your continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. At theſe words <hi>Florinda</hi> received ſo great content, that ſhe could not indure a greater, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feel in her heart ſomething more, than before ſhe was accuſtomed to find; and conſidering the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt reaſons he alleged, ſhe told him, That Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Honour had made anſwer for her, and did accord to that which he deſired. If <hi>Amadour</hi> was not joyfull of this aſſurance, I leave it to thoſe to judge who have been themſelves in love. But <hi>Florinda</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to follow his counſel more than he deſired; for ſhe who was fearfull, did not only forbear to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him before <hi>Paulina,</hi> but alſo before all others; and in this diſcontinuance of Diſcourſe, ſhe began her ſelf to ſuſpect the frequent communication which <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi> had with <hi>Paulina,</hi> who did like it very well, and now did confidently beleeve that <hi>Amadour</hi> did love her. <hi>Florinda</hi> to paſſe away this ſorrow, did daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain <hi>Aventurade,</hi> who began to be very jealous of her Husband and <hi>Paulina,</hi> and oftentimes did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it to <hi>Florinda,</hi> who did comfort her the beſt ſhe cold, being one who was infected her ſelf with the ſame Diſeaſe. <hi>Amadour</hi> quickly perceived by the Countenance of <hi>Florinda,</hi> that not only ſhe eſtranged her ſelf from him, according to his Counſel, but alſo that there was ſome ill opinion which was an Adjunct to it. One afternoon going with her to hear Veſpers in the Monaſtery, he ſaid unto her, Madam, with what countenance do you look upon me? <hi>Florinda</hi> made anſwer, With ſuch a one I think as you would have me. <hi>Amadour</hi> ſuſpecting what ſhe meant, and the better to find out the Truth, ſaid unto her, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119929:54"/>I have prevailed ſo much by my daily Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that <hi>Paulina</hi> hath no longer any ſuſpition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you. She replyed to him, You cannot do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your ſelf and for me, for in doing a Pleaſure to your ſelf, you do Honour to me. By theſe words <hi>Amadour</hi> was aſſured, that ſhe believed that he took a pleaſure to be in communication with <hi>Paulina,</hi> whereat he was ſo paſſionate, that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf, but in a great choler ſaid unto her, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, It is well begun to torment your Servant, for I never ſuffered any trouble that was more afflicting to me, than the conſtraint to ſpeak unto her whom I love not: And becauſe that which I have done for your ſervice is taken in another ſenſe, I will ſpeak no more unto her, let come what will come; and to the end to diſſemble as well my indignation as I have done my contentment, I will retire unto ſome other place, untill this Fancy of yours be paſſed over. But I hope I ſhall receive ſome news from my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to return unto the wars, where I will ſo long continue, that you ſhall underſtand, that not any in the world but your ſelf could have detained me in this place; and in ſpeaking thoſe words (without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending any anſwer) he immediately departed, and ſhe remained alone ſo ſad, and ſo diſconſolate, that it was impoſſible to be more. Love now being beaten by a contrary wind did begin to ſhew his overcoming power, inſomuch that ſhe acknowledged the Injury, and immediatly did write to <hi>Amadour,</hi> and beſought him that he would be pleaſed to return, which (ſome days being expired) when his great choler was aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he did accordingly. I know not in this place how to undertake to give you the leaſt account of the words that paſſed betwixt them to break this jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, but he did gain the day, inſomuch that ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him that ſhe would never believe any more that he loved <hi>Paulina,</hi> and withall that ſhe would remain aſſured, that it was a Martyrdom inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him to ſpeak either to <hi>Paulina</hi> or to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119929:54"/>unleſſe it were to do her ſelf ſervice. After that love had overcome this preſent ſuſpition, and the two Lovers did begin to take more delight than ever to converſe together, there arrived intelligence that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had commanded all his Army into <hi>Saulce.</hi> He therefore who was accuſtomed to be the foremoſt, failed not to be preſent where honor was to be purchaſed, but true it is, it was with ſome grief of heart which he was not accuſtomed to feel, as well to be deprived of his delight, as for fear that he ſhould find ſome great change at his return, becauſe that he ſaw <hi>Florinda</hi> was courted by great Princes and Lords, and was now arrived to the age of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years. He conſidered with himſelf that if in his abſence ſhe ſhould be married, he ſhould have no more occaſion to ſee her, unleſſe her mother the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> were pleaſed ſo far to honour his wife as to make her her Companion. And he ſo well ordered this affair among all her friends, that both the Counteſs &amp; <hi>Florinda</hi> promiſed him, that into what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Country ſhe was married, his wife <hi>Avanturade</hi> ſhould go with her: And although the queſtion was, that <hi>Florinda</hi> ſhould be married into <hi>Portugal,</hi> it was reſolv'd howſoever that his wife ſhould never abandon her. In this aſſurance, but not without an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable grief, <hi>Amadour</hi> departed and left his wife with the Counteſſe. When <hi>Florinda</hi> after the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of her Servant did find herſelf to be alone, ſhe exerciſed her ſelf in all good and vertuous imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, hoping thereby to attain the honour of the moſt abſolute Lady in that age, and to be reputed worthy to have ſuch a Servant. <hi>Amadour</hi> being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Barcelona</hi> was feaſted by the Ladies as he was accuſtomed heretofore, but they found him ſo much changed, that they thought that Marriage could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſuch power upon any as it had upon him, for he ſeemed unwilling to look on thoſe things which heretofore he delighted to behold, and the Counteſſe of <hi>Palamons</hi> her ſelf who had ſo intirely lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119929:55"/>him, could not find any means to perſwade him to go ſo far as her own houſe with her. <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi> made as little ſtay at <hi>Barcelona</hi> as poſſibly he could, for the Hours ſeemed tedious to him until he were in the place where honour might be obtained. Being atrived at <hi>Saulce</hi> there began a great and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl war betwixt the two Kings, of which I will give you no account in this place, nor of the brave at chiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which <hi>Amadour</hi> performed, for if I ſhould give you a juſt account of them it would make a large Volume: But you may underſtand that he was more renowned than all his Companions. The Duke of <hi>Naygueres</hi> not long after came to <hi>Perpignan,</hi> and brought with him two Thouſand men, and deſired <hi>Amadour</hi> to be his Licutenant, who with that Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade did ſo well his Devoir, that in all the skirmiſhes there were none other cryed up but the <hi>Naygueres.</hi> It ſo fell out, that the King of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who for a long time made War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> underſtanding that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were in War one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother upon the Frontires of <hi>Perpignan</hi> and <hi>Narbon,</hi> conceived, that he never in a better ſeaſon could do a diſpleaſure to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he therefore ſent a great number of Frigots and other Veſſels, to pillage and deſtroy that which they ſhould find to be ill guarded upon the confines of <hi>Spain.</hi> They of <hi>Barce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lona</hi> obſerving a great Fleet to paſſe by them, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe the King of it, who was then at <hi>Saulce,</hi> and immediatly commanded the Duke of <hi>Naygueres</hi> to march with all ſpeed to <hi>Palamons.</hi> When the <hi>Turkes</hi> underſtood that the place was ſo well guarded, they pretented to ſail beyond it, but upon the hour of mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night they returned, and laid ſo many of the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants upon the ground, that the Duke of <hi>Naygueres</hi> being ſurpriſed by his Enemies was led away priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Amadour</hi> who was very watchfull, heard the Alarum, and on a ſudden did draw into a body as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Souldiers as he could, and defended himſelf ſo well, that the whole power of his Enemies could
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119929:55"/>not for a long time be prejudicial to him. But in the end, underſtanding that the Duke of <hi>Naygueres</hi> was taken, and that the <hi>Turks</hi> were reſolved to ſet <hi>Palamons</hi> on fire, and to burn him in the houſe where he defended himſelf againſt them, he thought it ſafer to ſurrender himſelf, than to be the cauſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſo many gallant Souldiers who were in his Company, and having payed his ranſom, he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped withall, that he ſhould be ſo happy as to ſee again <hi>Florinda.</hi> On this, he yeelded himſelf priſoner to a <hi>Turk</hi> called <hi>Derlin,</hi> Governour of <hi>Tunis</hi> for the King, who immediately did bring him to his Maſter, where he was very well received and honoured, and had a ſtronger guard ſet on him; for the <hi>Turks</hi> thought, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him in their hands, that they had got the <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> In this condition <hi>Amadour</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued almoſt two yeats under the King of <hi>Tunis.</hi> In the mean time the News of this Captivity was brought into <hi>Spain,</hi> for which the Kinſmen of the Duke of <hi>Naygueres</hi> made a great lamentation, but thoſe who loved the honour of their Country, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem the loſſe of <hi>Amadour</hi> to be far greater. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Defeat was brought unto the Houſe of the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> at the ſame time when poor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanturade</hi> was extremely ſick. The Counteſſe, who had a great doubt her ſelf of the affection which <hi>Amadour</hi> did bear unto her Daughter, (which ſhe ſuffered and diſſembled, by reaſon of the great virtues which ſhe ſaw to ſhine in him) did call her Daughter to her, and did acquaint her with this melancholly News; <hi>Florinda,</hi> who knew well enough to diſſemble, ſaid unto her, that it was a great loſſe to all their Houſe, but moſt of all ſhe pityed his poor Wife, eſpecially conſidering the great weakneſſe ſhe was in; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Mother weep ſo bitterly, ſhe let fall a few tears alſo to keep her company, to the end that by diſſembling too much her diſſimulation might not be diſcovered. After that, her Mother did ſpeak often to her concerning him, but could never collect any
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119929:56"/>thing from her countenance whereby to aſſure her judgment. I will here forbear to make mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe Pilgrimages, Prayers, Oriſons and Faſts, which <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda</hi> ordinarily made for the ſafety and deliverance of <hi>Amadour,</hi> who as ſoon as ever he arrived at <hi>Tunis,</hi> did not fail to ſend the News of his Misfortunes to his friends, and by a ſure Meſſenger he advertiſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Florinda</hi> that he was in good health, and in good hope to ſee her again, which was the only comfort this poor young Lady had to ſuſtain her affliction. And you may be aſſured that ſhe found the means to write back unto him, which ſhe did ſo diligently, that <hi>Amadour</hi> could not complain for any want of comfort in her Letters and Epiſtles. Some moneths after the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> was commanded to come to <hi>Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſſa,</hi> where the King was arrived, and the young Duke of <hi>Cardona</hi> with him, who uſed ſuch importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the King and Queen, that they intreated the Counteſſe to make up the Marriage betwixt him and her Daughter. The Counteſſe being ſhe who in nothing would diſobey them, did conſent unto it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that her Daughter being very young had no other deſire but what was hers. When all was agreed upon, ſhe told her Daughter, That ſhe had made choice of that party for her who was moſt neceſſary. The Daughter knowing that in a thing that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done there needed not any more counſel, made anſwer to her, God be praiſed for all; And ſeeing her Mother to grow ſtrange unto her, ſhe choſe rather to obey her, than to have any pity on herſelf. And to increaſe her affliction, ſhe underſtood, that the Son of the Infant <hi>Fortunate</hi> was ſick unto Death, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Mother, or any other, ſhe made not the leaſt appearance of any ſorrow, and did contain her ſelf ſo much, that her tears by force being retired into her heart, did make the blood to ſpin out of her noſe in ſuch abundance, that ſhe was in danger of her life; but her Mother to recover her, did marry her unto him, whom willingly ſhe would have exchanged for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119929:56"/>her Death. After the celebration of this Marriage, <hi>Florinda</hi> did repair with her Husband into the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Cardona,</hi> and took along with her <hi>Avanturade,</hi> whom ſhe made partaker of her Complaints, as well of the ſeverity of her Mother, as of the grief ſhe had to have loſt the Son of the Infant <hi>Fortunate,</hi> but of her chief grief, for <hi>Amadour,</hi> ſhe ſpake not one word unto her, but only in the way to comfort her. After this, this young Lady did reſolve with her ſelf, to have God alwayes and her Honour before her eyes, and ſo well concealed her afflictions, that not any of her Servants did ever underſtand that her Husband was unpleaſing to her. Thus a long time <hi>Florinda</hi> continued, and lived a life not much better than Death; of which ſhe failed not to inform her good Servant <hi>Amadour,</hi> who knowing her great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart, and the love which ſhe did bear to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Fortunate,</hi> did conceive with himſelf, that it was impoſſible that ſhe ſhould live long, and did lament her, as one whom he concluded to be worſe than dead. This affliction did augment that which he had for himſelf, for he wiſhed that he might continue all his life a Slave, as he was, ſo that <hi>Florinda</hi> had but a Husband according to her deſire. Thus he forgat his own ſorrow, for that which he perceived his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe did endure. And becauſe he underſtood by a friend, That the King of <hi>Tunis</hi> had an Intent to ſend for him to the Court, and put him to death by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtake through him, or to make him renounce his Faith, for the deſire he had to have him turn <hi>Turk,</hi> and to keep him with him, he prevailed ſo much with the Governour that took him Priſoner, that he gave him leave to goe away upon his parole, to procure his Ranſom, which was ſo great, that he thought it was impoſſible for a Man of his Eſtate to pay it. And thus without ſpeaking one word to the King, the Governour let him go. Having ſhewed himſelf at Court to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he made no long ſtay there, but made haſt to procure his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119929:57"/>amongſt his Friends, to which purpoſe he did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his courſe to <hi>Barcelon,</hi> to which City the young D. of <hi>Cardona,</hi> his Mother, and <hi>Florinda</hi> were gon, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parch ſome buſineſſe. <hi>Avanturade,</hi> as ſoon as ſhe had heard the good news of the approach of her Husband, made no delay to acquaint <hi>Florinda</hi> with it, who was very joyfull to hear it, but ſo carried it, as it were for the love only ſhe did bear to <hi>Avanturade.</hi> But fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring leſt the Joy which ſhe had to ſee him, ſhould make her change her countenance, and that thoſe who did obſerve it might give a bad conſtruction to it, ſhe ſtayed at a window to ſee him afar off, and when ever ſhe did behold him to approach, ſhe went down a pair of winding ſtairs ſo obſcure, that one could not perceive that ſhe changed her colour; and having embraced him, ſhe brought him firſt into her own Chamber, and from thence into the Chamber of her Mother-in-Law, who had never ſeen him. But he had not continued there two dayes, but he ſo carried himſelf, that he was as well beloved there, as he was before in the Houſe of the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand.</hi> I will leave unto you to imagine what was the diſcourſe which <hi>Amadour</hi> and <hi>Florinda</hi> had between themſelves, and of the complaints they made of the ſorrows they had ſuffered in the abſence of one another. After a floud of tears from <hi>Florinda's</hi> eyes, for the grief ſhe entertained, as much that ſhe was married againſt her heart, as that ſhe had loſt him whom ſo intirely ſhe did love, and was out of hope ever to ſee him alive again, ſhe reſolved with her ſelf to take comfort in the love, and the aſſurance which ſhe had of <hi>Amadour,</hi> which nevertheleſſe ſhe durſt not declare unto him; but he who debated with himſelf what to do, did loſe neither time nor occaſion, to make her underſtand how great was the love which he did bear unto her. Juſt on the time as ſhe was almoſt gained to receive him, not as a ſervant, but for her beſt and moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red friend, there fell out a wonderfull Accident; For the King on ſome buſineſſe of great Importance, did
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119929:57"/>immediately ſend for <hi>Amadour,</hi> for which his Wife did take ſo great a grief, that in hearing of the News ſhe ſwouned away, and falling down the ſtairs on which ſhe ſtood, ſhe hurt her ſelf ſo grievouſly, that ſhe never did riſe up again. <hi>Florinda,</hi> who in her Death did loſe all her comfort, did make ſo great a Lamentation, as ſhe could do who found her ſelf deſtitute both of her Friends and Kinred: and <hi>Amadour</hi> took it as much to heart; for on the one ſide he loſt one of the moſt honeſt Women that ever lived; and on the other he loſt the means ever to be able to ſee <hi>Florinda</hi> again, by reaſon whereof he fell into ſo great a ſickneſſe, that he thought that immediately he ſhould die. The old Dutcheſſe of <hi>Cardona</hi> did viſit him unceſſantly, and alleged to him ſome Reaſons from Philoſophy, to cauſe him with Patience to endure that Death, but nothing would ſerve; for if Death on the one ſide did torment him, Love on the other did encreaſe his Martyrdom. <hi>Amadour</hi> obſerving that his wife was interred, and that the Goverour had ſent for him, and that it was impoſſible to pretend an excuſe to continue where he was, entertained ſuch a deſpair in his heart, that he thought he ſhould have loſt his life with his underſtanding. <hi>Florinda,</hi> who was in a deſolation her ſelf, to comfort him, did come unto him one day after dinner to adminiſter unto him the beſt words of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that ſhe could, hoping thereby to abate the greatneſſe of his grief, aſſuring him, that in what place ſoever he was, ſhe would find the means to ſee him, and oftner than he conceived. And becauſe he was to be gone the next morning, and was for the preſent ſo weak that he did keep his bed, he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech her that after every one was departed from him, ſhe would be pleaſed to give him a viſit in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which ſhe accorded to, being ignorant that the extremity of Love doth know no reaſon, and he who ſaw no hope left ever to ſee her again whom for ſo long a time he had ſerved, and who never had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:119929:58"/>any entertainment from her but what you have heard, was ſo aſſaulted with his love a long time diſſembled, and with deſpair that did preſent unto him that it was almoſt impoſſible for him to ſee her again, that he did reſolve with himſelf to play with her either Double, or Quit, either to loſe all, or to win all, and in one hour to pay himſelf with that, which he thought he had ſo well deſerved. For this purpoſe he commanded that the Curtains ſhould be drawn cloſe about his bed, that thoſe who came into the Chamber might not ſee him, and complained far more than he was accuſtomed to do, inſomuch that thoſe of the Houſe did think he could not live four and twenty hours longer. In the Evening after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one had been with him, <hi>Florinda</hi> (at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of her own Husband) did repair unto him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating with her ſelf (the more to comfort him) to declare unto him her affection, and that ſhe would love him altogether, and none but him as far as her honour would permit; and ſitting in a chair near to the teſter of <hi>Amadours</hi> bed, ſhe did begin to comfort him by weeping with him. <hi>Amadour</hi> ſeeing her fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with lamentation, thought that in that trouble of her mind he could moſt eaſily arrive to the end of his intention; and riſing up in his bed, <hi>Florinda</hi> thought that he was in ſome extaſie being too far ſpent, and with all the eyes of ſorrow began to look upon him, who kneeling on his knees did ſay unto her, And muſt I for ever loſe the ſight of you? and ſpeaking thoſe words he did let himſelf fall into her arms, juſt like a man that ſwouned away. Poor <hi>Florinda</hi> did imbrace him, and held him up a pretty while, doing the uttermoſt of her deſires to comfort him; but this Phyſick which ſhe gave him to amend his grief, did render his power more ſtrong, for in counterfeiting himſelf half dead and ſpeachleſs, he began to ſearch after that which the honour of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men doth forbid to be found: When <hi>Florinda</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his ill intention, ſhe could not believe it, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:119929:58"/>remembring the moſt civil and vertuous diſcourſe that had always paſſed betwixt them, ſhe ſaid unto him, What is it you would have? But <hi>Amadour</hi> fearing to hear her words, which he knew would be no other but chaſt and honeſt, returned no anſwer at all, but purſued his intention with all the force he had; whereat <hi>Florinda</hi> being amazed, ſuſpected that he was our of his wits, and would rather have conceived any thing of him than that he attempted to diſhonor her: Wherefore ſhe ſpake aloud and called unto a Gentleman whom ſhe knew to be in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hard by; whereat <hi>Amadour</hi> being throughly ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed did throw himſelf upon the bed, and that ſo ſuddenly, that the Gentleman believed that he had been dead. <hi>Florinda</hi> (who was riſen up from the chair) ſaid unto him, Go quickly, and bring hither ſome good Vinegar, which the Gentleman did, who being departed, <hi>Florinda</hi> began to ſay unto him, <hi>Amadour,</hi> what folly hath poſſeſſed your underſtanding? And what is that which you thought and would have don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? <hi>Amadour,</hi> who by the force of Love had loſt all his reaſon, did ſay unto her, Doth ſo long a ſervice as is mine, deſerve to be rewarded with ſuch a cruelty? <hi>Florinda</hi> replyed, And where is now the Honour concerning which ſo many times you have preached to me? O Madam, ſaid <hi>Amadour,</hi> It ſeems to me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to love your Honour more perfectly than I have done; For when you were to marry, I knew ſo well to maſter my heart, that you never underſtood my Deſires; but now ſince you are marryed, and your Honour may be concealed, What wrong do I do unto you, to demand that of you which is my own? for by the force of love I have gained you. He who firſt had your heart was ſo cold a Suiter to your body that he deſerved to loſe both together: He who doth now poſſeſſe your body, is not worthy to have your heart; wherfore neither is your Body his, nor can it properly appertain unto him. But I Madam, for the continued ſpace of five or ſix years, have endured ſo much love
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119929:59"/>and travel for you, that you cannot be ignorant, that both your heart and your body do pertain to me, for which I have ſo often hazarded my own. And if you think to defend your ſelf by Conſcience, be you aſſured, that thoſe who have proved the power of Love, will lay all the blame upon you who have ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed my liberty from me, and by your divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections blinded my underſtanding, that for the time to come not knowing what to do, I am conſtrained to be gone from you, without any hope of ever ſeeing you again. Nevertheleſſe you may be moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that in any part of the World whereſoever I ſhall be, whether it be on the Sea, or on the Land, or in the hands of my moſt cruel Enemies, you ſhall have my heart, which ſhall continue for ever yours: And if before my departure I could have that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from you which my great love doth merit, I ſhould be made ſtrong to endure with patience the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of my long abſence; And if you pleaſe not to grant me my requeſt, you will quickly hear it ſpoken, that your cruelty hath given me an unhappy Death. <hi>Florinda</hi> being tranſported with as much ſorrow as amazement to hear theſe words to proceed from him, of whom ſhe had never the leaſt ſuſpition, did reply in tears unto him, And woe is me now, <hi>Amadour,</hi> Are theſe the effects of the virtuous Diſcourſes which from my Youth hither to we have had together? Is this the Honour of Conſcience, which ſo oftentimes you have counſelled me rather to die, than to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don? Have you forgotten the great Examples you have inſtanced to me of ſo many excellent Ladies who have reſiſted that fooliſh Love? Have you forgotten the neglect which you your ſelf have had of light and inconſtant Ladies? I cannot beleeve, O <hi>Amadour,</hi> that you ſhould be ſo far from your ſelf, or that God, your Conſcience, and my Honour, ſhould be all dead in you. But if it be accordingly as you ſpeak, I bleſſe the Divine goodneſſe which hath prevented the miſchief into which I headlong was falling, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119929:59"/>me by your words, your heart, of which I was ſo much ignorant; for having loſt the Son of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant <hi>Fortunate,</hi> not only by being married my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, but becauſe I found, and ſufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that he loved another Lady, and ſeeing my ſelf married to one whom I cannot love, and that, let me do what I can, he cannot be agreeable unto me, I conſidered, and intirely reſolved with my ſelf to love you with all my heart and affections, grounding my love upon the Virtue which I have found in you, and which by your means, I have in ſome meaſure attain'd my ſelf, which is, to love my Honour and my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more than my life. To this rock of Honour I am come, where I was confident I ſhould find a moſt ſure foundation; but in one moment, <hi>Amadour,</hi> you have ſhewn me, that in the place of a Rock, ſure, as I thought and beautifull, the foundation of the building is upon looſe and uncertain Sands, or upon a ſoft and ruinous Bogg; And although I had already begun a great part of the building where I reſolved to have made my perpetual reſidence, you on the ſudden have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown it. Wherefore you ought by degrees to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all hopes which you have promiſed to your ſelf of me, and to reſolve with your ſelf, that in whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver place you ſee me, not to court me at all, either by words or countenance. And be not ſo vain to hope, that I either can or will ever change my thoughts. I ſpeak them to you with ſo much ſorrow, that it is impoſſible it ſhould be greater; but if I had procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo far as to have ſworn unto you perfect love, I do well perceive my heart to be ſuch, that it would have been dead within me in this rupture, although the amazement that is upon me (to be deceived by you) is ſo great, that I am confident it will render my life either ſhort or dolorous. And on theſe words I do bid you Adieu for ever.</p>
               <p>I will not here undertake to tell you the grief which entred into the heart of <hi>Amadour</hi> hearing theſe words, for it is not only impoſſible for a pen to expreſſe it,

Thoſe, Signior <hi>Amadour,</hi> who make it their buſineſſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low virtue, muſt not tread in that path in which you would go. But it is enough that heretofore I have lightly believed any Good in you, it is now time that I ſhould know the truth which doth deliver me from you. And ſpeaking thoſe words, ſhe departed out of the Chamber, and did weep away that night, finding ſo great a grief in this change, that her heart had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do to ſuſtain the aſſaults of ſorrow which love had given her; For although according to her
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119929:60"/>Reaſon ſhe reſolved never to love him more, yet he heart, which now was not ſubject to the rules of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, would not conſent unto it; wherefore being not able to love him leſſe than ſhe was accuſtomed to do, and knowing that love was the occaſion of that defect, ſhe determined with her ſelf to ſatisfy her love, and to love him with all her heart; but withall, to be no wayes forgetfull of her honour. In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Amadour</hi> departed ſick and ſad, as I have told you; nevertheleſſe his heart, which was ſo great, that the World could not ſhew an equal to it, did not ſuffer him to deſpair, but did give him a new intention to enjoy the preſence of <hi>Florinda,</hi> and again to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in her favour. Wherefore repairing to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was at <hi>Toledo,</hi> he made it his way to go by the Counteſſe of <hi>Arands,</hi> to whom he came one Evening very late, and found the Counteſſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſick, by reaſon of the ſorrow which ſhe had for the abſence of her Daughter <hi>Florinda.</hi> When ſhe beheld <hi>Amadour,</hi> ſhe kiſſed and embraced him as if he had been her own Son, as well for the love ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

In the morning he departed, and having diſpatched his affairs with the Queen, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Wars, but ſo ſad, and ſo changed in his complexion, that the Ladies, Captains, and all thoſe who had been accuſtomed to his Company, did not know him. He was altogether cloathed in black, and by the outward mourning which he made for his wife, he concealed the inward mourning of his heart. In this manner <hi>Amadour</hi> lived three or four years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119929:61"/>returning to the Court. And the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> hearing it ſpoken, that <hi>Florinda</hi> was ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altered that it would grieve any one to behold her, did ſend for her, hoping that ſhe would be joyfull to come to her; but it fell out to the contrary: for when <hi>Florinda</hi> underſtood that <hi>Amadour</hi> had declared to her Mother the love that was betwixt them, ſhe was in a wonderfull perplexity; for on the one ſide ſhe ſaw her Mother did eſteem ſo highly of him, that if ſhe ſhould acquaint her with the truth, <hi>Amadour</hi> would receive ſome great diſpleaſure, which ſhe would rather die than be the occuſion of, for ſhe thought her ſelf able enough to puniſh him for his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, without any aſſiſtance of her friends; On the other ſide ſhe feared, That in diſſembling the evil which ſhe knew, ſhe ſhould be conſtrained by her Mother, and by her friends, to continue her Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and to make much of him, by which ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that ſhe ſhould fortifie him in his Preſumptions. But ſeeing that he was far remote, ſhe made an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of being willing to it, and ſometimes did write unto <hi>Amadour</hi> when the Counteſſe did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her, but they were ſuch Letters, that it was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to be perceived, that they did proceed rather from obedience to her Mother, than good will to him. Wherefore <hi>Amadour</hi> was as much grieved at the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, as he was accuſtomed to rejoice at thoſe Letters which heretofore were ſent him. At the end of two or three years, after ſo many admirable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments in the Wars, that all the Paper in <hi>Spain</hi> was not able to contain them, he entertained a ſtrange invention, not to gain the heart of <hi>Florinda</hi> (for he held that for loſt) but to obtain another victory over her. He did caſt behind him all the Counſel of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and fear of Death it ſelf, to the danger whereof he did ſo manifeſtly expoſe himſelf. The Debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcuſſed and concluded, he prevailed ſo much upon the Governour, that he was deputed by him to go unto the King concerning ſome enterprize to be
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119929:61"/>made upon <hi>Locat,</hi> which he adventured to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> before he declared it to the King; to take her counſel therein, he came in Poſt into the County of <hi>Arand,</hi> where he knew that then <hi>Florinda</hi> was, and ſent privately a friend of his to the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand,</hi> to acquaint her with his comming, beſeeching her, That ſhe would be pleaſed to keep it ſecret, and that at night he would have ſome conference with her, without the knowledge of any one beſides. The Counteſſe being very joyfull of his comming, acquainted <hi>Florinda</hi> with it, and ſent to her to prepare her ſelf in the Chamber of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to the end that ſhe might be ready, when ſhe ſhould ſend for her, and when every one elſe were withdrawn. <hi>Florinda,</hi> who yet was not delivered from her firſt fear, made an apparence to her Mother, to do as ſhe commanded, but betook her ſelf to her Devotions, and did commend her ſelf to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to preſerve her heart from all inordinate affections; and conſidering with her ſelf, that <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour</hi> had often praiſed her beauty, which was not much diminiſhed, although ſhe had been a long time ſick, ſhe determined that it was better to commit an injury upon her beauty, than by her means to ſuffer that the heart of ſo brave a Man ſhould burn in ſo looſe a fire: Wherefore ſhe took a great ſtone which ſhe found in the Chapel, and gave her ſelf ſo great a blow on the face, that her mouth, her noſe, and her eyes were all hurt and bruized with it. And becauſe it might not be ſuſpected that ſhe her ſelf had done it, when the Counteſſe her Mother ſent for her, ſhe fell down at the door of the Chapel upon a great ſtone, and crying out aloud, the Counteſſe came her ſelf to her relief, and found her in that pitifull eſtate; Her face was immediately dreſſed, which being done, the Counteſſe did bring her into her own Chamber, and did intreat her to repair into her Cabinet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain <hi>Amadour</hi> until ſuch time as ſhe could get cleer of the Company that was with her, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Having entertained her with a ſhort Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and found her in the ſame mind as he left her, and that ſhe had rather die than change her opinion, he ſaid unto her, Madam, I vow unto you, the fruit of my labour ſhall not be taken from me for a ſcruple, and ſince that Love, Patience, and humble Prayers can nothing prevail upon you, I will not ſpare by force to obtain that, which if not had, will procure my Death; when <hi>Florinda</hi> ſaw his face and eyes ſo much changed, and that the beſt Complexion in the world did grow red as fire, and that moſt ſweet and pleaſant look did become ſo horrible and furious, that the fire ſeem'd to ſparkle forth from his eyes, which burn'd in his heart, And when in that fury, with one of his ſtrong hands he had taken faſt hold of both her weak and delicate ones, ſhe ſeeing that all the defence that ſhe could make did fail her, and that both her hands and her feet were held in ſuch capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, that ſhe could neither fly, nor defend her ſelf, and knew not what remedy to find, unleſſe it were to ſee if any little root of his firſt love remained, in the honour of which he might forget his cruelty, ſhe ſaid unto him, <hi>Amadour,</hi> If now you are an Enemy unto me, I muſt beſeech you for the honeſty of the love which at other times I have found in your heart, that you will firſt hear me, before you will torment me. When ſhe perceived that he began to give ear unto her, (following her Diſcourſe) ſhe ſaid unto him, Alas <hi>Amadour!</hi> What occaſion doth tranſport you to look after a thing, of which, if enjoyed, you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Content, and which will bring unto me the greateſt ſorrow that poſſibly I can have. You have had ſuch experience of my good will unto you ſince the time of my Youth, and of my greateſt Beauty,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119929:62"/>(for which your paſſion might find ſome excuſe) that I do much wonder that in my greater age, and this Deformity into which Misfortune hath now brought me, you have the heart and deſire to torment me. I am aſſured you know that my Will is the ſame which it hath been accuſtomed to be, ſo that you cannot have, unleſſe it be by force, that which you do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; And if you obſerve but how my face is marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (in the forgetting the beauty which you have ſeen in it) you would no longer have a deſire to come neer me; and if there doe as yet remain any relicks of love in you, it is impoſſible but that your pity ſhould overcome your ſury; And to that pity and honeſty which I have ſo often found in you, I do ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe my complaint, and do deſire their protection, to the end that according to their better counſels you would permit me to live in peace and honeſty, which I have reſolved to doe. But if the love which you have born unto me is converted all into hate; and if rather for vengeance than affection you will make me the moſt wretched woman in the world, I do aſſure you, that it ſhall not be ſo, and that you will inforce me (againſt my reſolution) to declare your cruelty, and inordinate appetite to her, who doth conceive ſo well of you, and, in that apprehenſion, you may aſſure your ſelf that your life will be in danger. <hi>Amadour</hi> breaking off her Diſcourſe, ſaid unto her, If I muſt die, I care not, I will be immediately freed of my torment, and the deformity of your face (which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve was done by your own Will) ſhall not hinder my will, for if I could have nothing but your bones only, I would keep them alwayes with me. When <hi>Florinda</hi> ſaw that neither her prayers, reaſons, nor her tears could work any Impreſſion upon him, and that ſo great a fury did purſue his wicked deſires that ſhe no longer could make reſiſtance, ſhe ayded her ſelf with a remedy which ſhe feared as much as the loſſe of his life, and with a ſad and pitifull voice called to her Mother, as lowd as poſſibly ſhe could, who hearing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119929:63"/>her daughter to cry unto her in ſuch a manner, had a marvellous great fear of that which was probable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and did run as faſt as her legs could carry her into her Wardrobe. <hi>Amadour,</hi> who was not ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to die as he pretended, did let go his Prize in ſo good a time, that the Lady opening her Cabanet did find him at the door, and <hi>Florinda</hi> ſtanding a good way from him; The Counteſſe demanded of him, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madour,</hi> what is the matter, tell me the Truth? He who was never unprovided of an Excuſe, with a pale Countenance ſaid unto her, Madam, Into what a Temper is Madam <hi>Florinda</hi> brought? I was never ſo amazed as at this preſent, I thought that I had ſome part in her affection, but I have nothing leſſe. It ſeems to me, Madam, that ſince the time ſhe was brought up under you, ſhe was never leſſe wiſe nor virtuous than now ſhe is. She was accuſtomed to make no conſcience to ſpeak, or to look on any, and now I would but only look on her, and ſhe would not permit me, and when I beheld her face (not thinking it was ſo altered) I demanded to kiſſe her hand, according to the faſhion of the Country, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together refuſed me. Madam, It is true that I have done her wrong, for which I demand pardon of you: It was, that I took her hand by force, and kiſſed it, demanding no other contentment of her, but ſhe who (as I believe) hath determined my death, cried out unto you, (as you did hear) I cannot tell for what, unleſſe ſhe entertains a fear, that I had other deſires about me than indeed I have; Nevertheleſſe, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, in whatſoever manner it be, I dow avow the Injury to be mine; for although ſhe ought to love all your good Servants, yet Fortune hath ſo ordered it, that I alone, and the moſt affectionate of them all, am turned out of her favour. Nevertheleſſe I will alwayes continue moſt faithfull both to you and her. And I muſt beſeech you, Madam, that you will be pleaſed to continue me in your good opinion, ſince without any demerit of mine, I have loſt hers. The Counteſſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:119929:63"/>who in part did believe, and in part did ſuſpect what he alleged, did goe unto her Daughter, and ſaid unto her, Wherefore did you call upon me with ſo lowd a voice? <hi>Florinda</hi> made anſwer, Becauſe I was ſtruck with a ſudden fear; and although the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe did put many Interrogatories to her concerning <hi>Amadour,</hi> both at this preſent, and many times after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, yet ſhe never would make any other anſwer to her; for ſeeing that ſhe had eſcaped out of his hands, ſhe thought him ſufficiently puniſhed having hindred his enterprize. After that the Counteſſe had a long time ſpoken to <hi>Amadour,</hi> ſhe ſuffered him before her to ſpeak unto <hi>Florinda,</hi> to obſerve what Countenance he carried to her, to whom he ſpake but little, but only thanked her, becauſe ſhe confeſſed not the truth unto her mother, and beſought her, that ſince he had loſt his place in her affections, that no other might be poſſeſſed in it. To the firſt ſhe made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That if ſhe had known any other means to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her ſelf from him, but her voice only, her voice ſhould never have been heard, neither by her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor any other. To the ſecond, ſhe deſired him never to fear that ſhe would love any other, for ſince ſhe had not found in the heart of that Man, whom ſhe eſteemed to be the moſt virtuous in the world, that Good which ſhe expected, ſhe would never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to beleeve that it can be in any others. This Misfortune, ſhe ſaid, ſhould be a Help unto her, to preſerve her ſelf ever in liberty from thoſe paſſions which Love doth bring. And having ſpoke theſe words, ſhe took her leave of him. Her Mother who obſerved her Countenance, knew not what to judge of it, but after that time ſhe perceived plainly that her Daughter did no more affect <hi>Amadour,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded thereupon, that ſhe was of a croſſe diſpoſition, and hated all thoſe things which ſhe loved, and from that hour did carry her ſelf ſo ſtrangely to her, that ſhe ſpoke not one word to her in ſeven years together, unleſſe it were to chide her, and all this was at the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119929:64"/>requeſt of <hi>Amadour.</hi> During this time <hi>Florinda</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the fear which ſhe had to be with her Husband, into a deſire to be never from him, only thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the rigour of her Mother: But ſeeing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would prevail, ſhe reſolved with her ſelf to be even with <hi>Amadour;</hi> and for two or three dayes together looking upon him with a more pleaſing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſhe counſelled him to hold diſcourſe of love with a Lady, who, ſhe ſaid, had ſpoken very liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of theirs. This Lady was in the Court of the Queen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was called <hi>Loretta;</hi> ſhe was proudly glad to have obtained ſuch a Servant as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madour,</hi> and ſo great were the familiarities betwixt them, that the report thereof was noiſed every where, and the Counteſſe of <hi>Arand</hi> being at Court did her ſelf perceive it; wherefore afterwards ſhe did not ſo much torment <hi>Florinda</hi> as ſhe had been accuſtomed to do. <hi>Florinda</hi> one day underſtood, that the Captain (the Husband of <hi>Loretta</hi>) was poſſeſſed with ſo great a Jealouſie, that he was reſolved, by one means or other, to kill <hi>Amadour; Florinda,</hi> who for all her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled countenance, could carry no ill will in her heart to <hi>Amadour,</hi> did immediately advertiſe him of it; but he who was moſt eaſie to be drawn into his firſt train, did make anſwer to her, That if ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to entertain him but three hours in a day, he would never ſpeak to <hi>Loretta</hi> more, which ſhe would not conſent unto, Whereupon <hi>Amadour</hi> ſaid unto her, Since you will not have me to live, wherefore do you deny me to dye? unleſſe you hope to give me more puniſhments by life than a thouſand Deaths can afflict upon me. But although Death doth flie me, I will never leave looking after it, untill I have found it; for in Death onely I ſhall have Reſt. Whiles they were in this Conference, news was received that the King of <hi>Granada</hi> had begun a moſt cruel War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> inſomuch that the King had ſent thither the Prince his Son, and with him the Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> as two
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119929:64"/>Adjunct, of great truſt and experience; Whereupon the Duke of <hi>Cardona,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Arand</hi> would not ſtay behind, and beſought the King to aſſign them ſome charge in the Army, which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Houſes, and appointed <hi>Amadour</hi> to be their Guide, who during the War was ſo famous for his atchievments, that they ſeemed rather to proceed from a deſperat raſhneſſe, than a well-grounded re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and to give you the intention of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I muſt inform you, that his great Courage was approved to his Death: For the <hi>Moors</hi> pretending that they would give battel to the Army of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, having better obſerved how it was marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and how great it was, did make as though they fled, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did follow them in the purſute, but the old Conſtable, and the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Stratagem of the <hi>Moors,</hi> with much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity did withhold the Prince of <hi>Spain</hi> that he paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the River, which, notwithſtanding the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the contrary, the Count of <hi>Arand,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Cardona</hi> did, and when the <hi>Moors</hi> ſaw that they were followed with ſo unconſiderable a number, they did return upon them, and with one blow of a Scemiter, did Iay the Duke of <hi>Cardona</hi> dead upon the place, and ſo wounded the Count of <hi>Arand,</hi> that he fell to the Ground. Upon this Defeat <hi>Amadour</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſo furious and enraged, that with great ſlaughter he did break through the Army of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and commanded the two Bodies of the Duke and of the Count to be taken up, and to be brought into the Princes Camp, who did ſo much lament their deaths, as they had been his own Brothers. But, in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their wounds, he found the Count of <hi>Arand</hi> yet living, who was ſent in a Litter to his own houſe, where he continued a long time ſick, and on the other ſide the body of the young Duke was brought unto <hi>Cardona. Amadour</hi> having done his endeavour to bring off theſe two Dukes, did think ſo little of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he was ſuddenly invironed with a great
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119929:65"/>number of the <hi>Moors,</hi> and he who would no more be taken, having loſt his Miſtreſs, falſified not his faith which he made unto God &amp; her; &amp; knowing, That if he ſhould be brought to the King of <hi>Granada,</hi> that either he ſhould cruelly die, or renounce his Chriſtianity, he did reſolve with himſelf to adde Glory to his Death, and kiſſing the Croſſe on the hilt of his ſword, (rendring his Soul and Body to his Creator) he did give himſelf ſo mortal a blow, that there needed not a Second to diſpatch him. So dyed the poor <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi> and was as much lamented as his Virtues de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The News thereof was immediately carried through all <hi>Spain;</hi> inſomuch that <hi>Florinda</hi> who was at <hi>Barcelona,</hi> where her Husband was interred, after that ſhe had honourably performed the Funerals, without ſpeaking either to her own Mother, or her Mother-in-Law, or any other, did render her ſelf a Votareſs in the Monaſtery of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> taking him for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and her Friend, who had delivered her from a love ſo vehement as that of <hi>Amadour,</hi> and from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution ſo grievous as was the Company of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. She imployed all her affections to the love of God, and that ſo perfectly, that having lived a long time a religious life, ſhe ſurrendred her Soul to God, with ſo much joy as the Eſpouſed doth go to behold her Spouſe.</p>

After that</hi> Parlament <hi>had ſpoke ſo long, ſhe turning to</hi> Hircan <hi>ſaid unto him, It appeareth now plainly to you, that this Lady was ſollicited and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the laſt, and that moſt virtuouſty ſhe reſiſted.

They have the honour, which Men at their pleaſure can give and take from them, and beholding that we patiently do endure, it is reaſon they conceive, that our ſufferance ſhould be recompenced, when their Honour is not wounded.

Becauſe all have ſpoken now, ſaid</hi> Ouebron, <hi>it ſeems to me that</hi> Amadour <hi>was at gallant &amp; virtuous a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as a man can be; and becauſe the Names are feigned, I ſuppoſe I did know him; but ſeeing that</hi> Parlament <hi>would not give him his right Name, no more will I.

For ſee yonder how far the Sun is gone, and you may hear the Bell of the Abbey, which a long time hath called us to the Veſpers, of which I have not adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed you, for the Devotion to hear the end of this Account, was more great than that to hear Veſpers. And in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe words, they did all ariſe, and comming to the Abbey they found there the religious Men, who had atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them above an hour. Veſpers being heard, they repaired to Supper, and all the Evening they diſcourſed of ſtories which they had heard, and examined their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to ſee if they could make the following Dayes work as delightfull as was the former; and after a thouſand ſports and courſes in the Meadow, they reſorted to their Reſts, crowning the firſt Dayes work with a moſt joyfull period.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Eer unto the City of <hi>Blere</hi> in <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> there is a Town called St. <hi>Martin le-beau;</hi> to which place a Frier of the Covent of <hi>Tours</hi> was called to preach on the <hi>Advents,</hi> and in the <hi>Lent</hi> enſuing. This Frier, more lowd than learned, having not wherewith to inform his Auditors, did deliberate with himſelf to begin his <hi>hour</hi> with ſome account that might give ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the people of the Village. On <hi>Maundy-Thurſday,</hi> preaching of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> when he came to ſpeak that it was to be eaten at night, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119929:68"/>beheld ſo many young and fair Women of <hi>Amboys</hi> to be preſent at his Sermon, who were lately arrived to keep there their <hi>Eaſter,</hi> and to continue in that place ſome dayes afterwards, he began to be on a merry pin, and demanded of all the Women that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, if they knew not what it was to eat raw fleſh at night? (Ladies, I aſſure you I ſpeak his own words after him) The young Men of <hi>Amboys</hi> who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and came commonly with their Wives, Siſters, and Kinſwomen, and who knew not the humor of the Confeſſor, began to be offended at him; But after that they had heard him further, they turned their ſcandal into laughter, eſpecially when he ſaid, That to eat the <hi>Paſchal Lamb,</hi> they muſt have girded their reins, and their feet on their ſhooes, and their hands in the ſtaff. The Frier obſerving them to laugh, and doubting for what it was, did immediately correct himſelf, and well, well, ſaid he, their ſhooes then on their feet, and a ſtaff in their hands; A hat white, or a white hat, is it not all one? His auditors did fall all a-laughing at this, and the Ladies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could not contain, to whom he did apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with variety of ſuch vain diſcourſe; and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that his hour was almoſt out, he was unwilling that the young Women ſhould depart diſcontented from him, he ſaid therefore unto them, And now my young Ladies, I am ſure, that by and by you will in your prattle, ask the Goſſips that are with you, What Mr. Frier is this that delivers himſelf ſo confidently this day? Why I will tell you Ladies, he is a good Fellow, and be not you aſtoniſhed, be not, I ſay, though he talketh never ſo lowdly; for I am of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and at your ſervice, Ladies. And ſpeaking thoſe words, he did make an end of his Preachment, by which he did leave his Auditors more ready to laugh at his fooliſh diſcourſe, than to weep in the memory of the Paſſion of our Saviour, the Commemoration whereof was then to be ſolemnized. His other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, during the ſaid Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> were of the ſame
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119929:68"/>efficacy. And, as you know well enough, that theſe Brothers are very forward in their exhortations to receive their benevolences at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> by which they have not onely their Eggs given them, but many other things, as odd Remnants of Linnen, and Flax, Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, Gammons, or Leggs of Bacon, and Chines of Bacon, and many other ſuch ſmall Collations; <hi>Eaſter</hi> Tueſday being come, when he was to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations (of which theſe people are alwayes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral enough) he directing his courſe again to the Women, ſaid, Ladies, I am bound to give you thanks for your liberality which you have ſhewed to our poor Covent, but it is requiſite that I ſpeak plain unto you, That you have not conſidered of the Neceſſities in which we ſtand; for the greateſt part of that which you have given us, are Links and Puddings, and, God be praiſed, we have no need of them; our Covent is full of good Puddings already, What ſhall we doe with them then? would you know what? Ladies I ſhall adviſe you then, if you would but put your Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to our Puddings, you would give us a good Alms indeed. In this manner continuing his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he gave a new occaſion of offence; and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed very briskly from above, &amp; having inſtanced ſome Examples, he did put himſelf into an Admiration, and ſaid, My good Sirs, and Ladies of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> I am much aſtoniſhed at you, that you ſhould make ſtrange at that which is nothing, and ſpeaking of me to one another, ſhould ſay, This is a ſtrange Frier, I will tell you what; Suppoſe that a Monk ſhould get the Daughter of his Hoſteſſe with Child, this would be ſome wonder, that a Monk ſhould get a Girl with Child, but let us come to the point, my Ladies, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this Girl ſhould get the Monk with Child, why there would be your cauſe of wonder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119929:69"/>to make any diſcourſe at all, which is not wholly for the Inſtruction of his neighbours, or the glory of God. This was a Maſter-Frier in earneſt, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>I ſhould love him as well as I do Frier</hi> Annebant, <hi>on whoſe back I would put all the merry Diſcourſe which can be delivered in a whole Pariſh.</hi> Oyſilla <hi>made anſwer, I love not to have men laugh at ſuch prophaneneſs, especially in this Caſe.</hi> Nomerfide <hi>replyed, Madam, it is not long ago, if it be not ſo ſtill, that not only the honeſt people of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, but alſo a conſiderable part in the greateſt Towns (who think better of themſelves than the reſt) had ſuch Preachers in far greater Reverence, than thoſe who purely and ſincerely preached the Holy Goſpel. In whatſover ſort it was, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>Was it not an Injury to demand the Womens Gammons to be mingled with their Puddings, ſince there is far more meat in the Gammons? Nay, and if ſome devout Woman had underſtood him, according to his fallacy, (as I believe that he himſelf did mean it) neither he nor his Companions would be in any other conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than the young Girl who had her Sack too full. But you may behold, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>what a most impudent Man this was, to corrupt at his pleaſure the Text of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thinking to meet with ſuch Beaſts as himſelf, and in doing ſo, moſt wickedly to endeavour to ſupplant poor women, by teaching them how to eat raw fleſh at night. You take no notice at all, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that he ſaw before him the young women of</hi> Amboys, <hi>in whoſe Troughs he would willingly have waſhed his Whatch-I-call-it; No: but you underſtand it well enough; and make them to taſt it, not roſted, but hot in a wanton Exerciſe, to give them greater pleaſure. Good, good (Signior</hi> Simontault, <hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>you do forget your ſelf, or do you keep your accuſtomed Modeſty in Reſerve, to be only ready when you have need of it. No Madam, ſaid he, but the diſhoneſty of the Monk did cauſe me ſo far to wander from my ſelf; Therefore to put our ſelves again into our firſt courſe, I deſire</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>who was the occaſion of my digreſſion, to give her voice to ſome one who might make us to forget our common fault. Since you make me to

               <p>SOme time ſince, in the City of <hi>Florence</hi> there lived a Duke, who eſpouſed Madam <hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; and becauſe ſhe was ſo young, that it was nor yet lawfull for him to lie with her, he entertained her very honourably and lovingly, until ſhe did arrive unto the ripeneſs of age. For, to forbear her, he became amorous of ſome other Ladies in the City, whom in the night he went to court when his Wife was aſleep. Amongſt others, there was a moſt beautifull and virtuous Lady, who was Siſter to a Gentleman whom the Duke loved as himſelf, and to whom he gave ſo much authority in his Houſe, that his word was obeyed, and feared, as that of the Dukes, and he had no ſecret in his heart, which he declared not unto him: Inſomuch, that he might well be called his ſecond Self. The Duke obſerving his Siſter to be ſo accompliſhed a Lady, and that he had not the means to declare the love which he did bear unto her; having ſought all wayes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119929:70"/>that were poſſible for the effecting of it, at laſt addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf to the Gentleman whom ſo intirely he did affect, &amp; ſaid unto him, If there were any thing in the world (my Friend) which I would not do for you, I ſhould be affraid to declare unto you my thoughts, and much more to deſire you to be ayding to me in them, but I bear you ſo much good will, that if I had Wife, Mother, or Daughter, that might conduce to ſave your Life, I would rather imploy them all in it, than to ſuffer you to die in torment; and I believe that the Love which you bear to me is reciprocal to mine. And if I who am your Maſter do bear ſuch an affection to you, I preſume that you do not bear any leſſe to me: Wherefore I will declare one ſecret to you, the concealment whereof doth keep me in this eſtate, wherein you ſee me, of which I can look for no amendment, but onely by Death, or by the ſervice which you may do me. The Gentleman obſerving the Reaſons of his Maſter, and that his face in earneſt was bathed in tears, had ſo great a compaſſion of him, that he ſaid unto him, Sir, I am your Creature, all the Fortunes and Honours I enjoy, do proceed from you, you may ſpeak to me as to your friend, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, That all which lies in my power is in your own hands. Incontinently the Duke began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare unto him the love which he did bear unto his Siſter, which was ſo great and violent, that if by his means he had no redreſſe, he found he could not live long; for he knew by experience, that neither Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor Prayers, nor Preſents, could prevail upon her: Wherefore he conjured him, If he loved his life, as deerly as his life was beloved by him, that he would find a means to procure him that benefit, which without him, he concluded, it was impoſſible to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. The Brother, who loved his Siſter, and the honor of his Houſe more than the pleaſure of the Duke, did endeavour to make him ſome Remonſtrance to the contrary, beſeeching him in all other ways to imploy him, but to excuſe him onely in this thing, it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119929:70"/>being too cruel and too unnatural to him to purchaſe the diſhonor of his own bloud, &amp; that neither his heart nor his Honour could comply with this Command. The Duke enflamed with an anger inſupportable, did bite his nails, and made reply unto him in great fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, It is no matter, ſeeing I find in you no reſpects of Friendſhip to me, I know what I have to do. The Gentleman underſtanding the cruelty of his Maſter, was ſtruck into a fear, and ſaid unto him, Sir, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is your pleaſure, I will ſpeak unto her, and I will give you an account of her anſwer to me.

On one ſide there was preſented to him the Obligation which he owed to his Maſter, and the benefits, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours which he had received from him. On the other ſide his thoughts reflected on the Honour of his Houſe, the honeſty and chaſtity of his Siſter, and the aſſurance he had that ſhe would never conſent to ſo foul a Motion, if ſhe were not ſurprized by deceit, or by force. Wherefore having taken theſe Premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into his conſideration, he concluded, That he would rather die, than be the Author of ſo ill an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his Siſter, who was one of the moſt virtuous Ladies in all <hi>Italy.</hi> He was rather obliged, he did judge, to deliver his Countrey from ſuch a Tyrant, who by force would ſtain the Honour of his Family. He was aſſured, beſides, that unleſſe the Duke was dead, the life of himſelf and of his Siſter were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely loſt. Wherefore, without ſo much as ſpeaking one word unto his Siſter, he determined with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſave his own life, and by the ſame way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the ſhame which was intended to be brought upon her. At the end of two dayes he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Duke, and told him how he had practiſed with his Siſter, who (but not without great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119929:71"/>did conſent unto his pleaſure, which ſhe hoped ſhould be kept ſecret, ſeeing none but himſelf, who was her own Brother, had any knowledge of it. The Duke, who deſired this News, did eaſily believe it, and imbracing the Meſſenger, did promiſe him what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he would demand, and deſiring him that it might quickly be put in execution, they agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themſelves upon the day. If the Duke were not high with hopes and Joyes, I will leave it to you to judge. When he ſaw the night ſo much deſired to approach, in which he promiſed himſelf to have the Victory over her, whom he thought invincible, he withdrew himſelf betimes from his Court, having none in his Company but this Gentleman alone, and forgot not to take along with him a Night-cap, and a ſhirt perfumed in the beſt manner as poſſibly it might be. And taking his opportunity in the Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, he did go along with this Gentleman to the Lodging of this Lady, where he came into a Chamber very richly prepared. The Gentleman aſſiſted him to put off his cloaths, and helped him into Bed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, Sir, I will now go and ſetch her my ſelf unto you, who will not enter into this Chamber with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many bluſhes, but I hope before the Morning ſhe will be aſſured of you. In this manner her left the Duke, and did go into his own Chamber, where he found but one of all his Servants, to whom he ſaid, Have you the heart to follow me into a place where I will revenge my ſelf on the greateſt Enemy I have in the world? His Man not knowing what he would do, ſaid unto him, Yes Sir, and it were the Duke himſelf. Immediatly the Gentleman did take him with him, who on the ſudden had not the leiſure to take any other A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119929:71"/>of beholding her from whom he hoped to have the preſervation of his life, he beheld the precipitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his death, which was a drawn ſword which the Gentleman had in his hand, with which he ſtruck at the Duke with all his force, who was in his ſhirt, and being without arms, but not without heart, defended the blow with the Bed-cloaths, and taking hold of the Gentleman about the body, ſaid unto him, Is this the fulfilling of the promiſe which you made me? And ſeeing he had no other weapon but his teeth and nails, he did bite the Gentleman on the pulſe of his hands, and with the ſtrength of his arms did ſo long defend himſelf, that they both fell down between the Wall and the Bed. The Gentleman who began to be overborn by him, called to his ſervant, who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Duke and his Maſter ſo tyed together, that he knew not which of them to chooſe, did dragg them both by the feet into the middle of the Room, and with his Poynard did cut the throat of the Duke, who defended himſelf until the loſſe of bloud did render him ſo feeble, that he could make no more oppoſition. Then the Gentleman and his Servant did carry him into the bed, where with many blows and thruſts of the Ponyard they did over-act their Murder. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, having drawn cloſe the Curtains, they did both depart, and ſhut up the dead Body in the Chamber. When the Gentleman ſaw himſelf victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over his Enemy, by whoſe death he thought to procure the Liberty of the Publick, he conceived that his work was imperfect, if he did not as much to five or ſix more of thoſe who were next in power to the Duke. And to put his hand to the work, he told his Servant, that he ſhould go for them one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do with them as he had done with the Duke. But his Servant, who was not of any great heart or courage, ſaid unto him; Sir, Methinks you have done well enough already for one time, and that you ſhould rather think of ſaving your own life, than of taking more lives away from others; for if we ſhould
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:119929:72"/>ſtay to do as much to every one of them, as we have done unto the Duke, the day would diſcover our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerprize, before we ſhould have put any period to it, although we ſhould have found them all without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The Gentleman, whoſe evill conſcience did render him fearful, did beleeve his Servant, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him along with him, he addreſſed himſelf to the Biſhop, in whoſe Cuſtody were the charge of the Keys of the City, and the Command of the Poſt-horſes. The Gent. ſaid unto him, I have this Evening received News, that my Brother is on the point of Death, I have been to demand leave of the Duke to go unto him, who hath granted it; Wherefore I deſire you to command the Poſts to let me have two good horſes, and the Porter of the City to open the Gates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. The Biſhop, who eſteemed his intreaty no leſſe than the Commandement of the Duke, with whom he knew he was moſt gracious, did give him incontinently a Ticket, by virtue whereof both the Gates of the City were opened to him, and the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſes ſuddenly provided, accordingly as he deſired. And inſtead of ſeeing his Brother, he took his way directly to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he cauſed the bitings which the Duke had given him, to be healed, and not long after he travelled into <hi>Turkey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Morning the Servants of the Duke found it very long before he came forth, and did attend his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; for they ſuſpected that he was gone to ſee ſome Lady: But ſeeing the morning far ſpent, and they could hear nothing of him, they began to look for him in every place. The poor Dutcheſſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to affect him moſt intirely, underſtanding that they could not hear any News of him, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But when the Gentleman, whom ſo well he loved, could be heard of no more than himſelf, they reſorted to his houſe to ſeek him our, and finding ſome drops of bloud at his Chamber door, they did enter into his Chamber, and found not any there to give them the leaſt Intelligence; but their ſuſpition
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119929:72"/>increaſing, they followed the tracts of the bloud, and came to the Door of the Chamber where the Duke was, which they found locked, and having broken open the Door they found the place full of bloud, and drawing the Curtains, they found the body in the Bed aſleep, to wake no more. You may imagine what Lamentation his poor Servants made, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed his dead body into the Palace, whither the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop came, and informed them how in the time of night the Gentleman in great diligence departed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence to ſee his Brother. By which it moſt clearly did appear, that it was hewho did commit that Murther. And it was alſo proved, That his poor Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter did never hear the leaſt word of any thing; who, although ſhe was aſtoniſhed at the ſad news ſhe heard, yet it increaſed her love unto her Brother, who had delivered her from ſo cruel a Prince, the Enemy of her Chaſtity, by the apparent hazard of his own life; And continuing more and more her Progreſſe in all virtues, although ſhe was poor (for her Houſe and all her goods were confiſcated) ſhe found good friends &amp; rich Kinred in <hi>Italy,</hi> by whom being aſſiſted, ſhe lived a long time in great and good reputation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, here you ſee what may make you fear that little God, who taketh delight to torment Princes, as well as Beggars, and the mighty as well as the feeble, and who doth render them ſo blind, that they loſe God, and their Conſcience, and at laſt their own lives. And Princes, and thoſe who are in authority, may well be afraid how they diſpleaſe thoſe who are inferiours to them, for there is none ſo weak, but he can do hurt, when God will take vengeance upon a ſinner, nor ſo great, that can guard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from his Enemy, when he is under his power. This Hiſtory was much liſtned to by all the Company, but it produced great diverſities of Judgement; for ſome main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that the Gentleman had done his duty in ſaving his own life, and the honour of his Siſter, as alſo in delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Country from a Tyrant. Others were of another mind, and affirmed, that it was a great Ingratitude in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119929:73"/>Gentleman to put him to death, who had beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him ſo many benefits and honours. The Ladies ſaid, that he was a good Brother, and a virtuous Citizen. The Men profeſſed the contrary, and that he was a Traitor, and a wicked Servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It would be requiſite in this place to allege the reaſons on both ſides, but the Ladies (according to their Cuſtom) did ſpeak as much by paſſion as by reaſon, aſſirming, that the Duke was worthy of Death, and that happy was the hand that did give the blow; wherefore</hi> Dagoucin <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the great conteſtation that he had made amongſt them, did ſay unto them, For Gods ſake Ladies, Let there be no more a quarrell concerning a thing already paſſed, but take heed that your own beauties do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi! more cruel Murders than hers of whom I have given you an account.</hi> Parlament <hi>ſaid, The fair Lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy hath taught us to ſay, That her gracious Malady many did ſlay. Madam, I would to God ſaid</hi> Dagou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin, <hi>that all the Ladies in this Company did know how falſe that opinion is, I believe they would not own the Name to be without Mercy, nor reſemble that incredulous Woman, who did let her Servant die in refuſing to give him a gracious anſwer. You would then</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>to ſave the life of one who ſaith be loveth us, that we loſe at once both our Honours and our Conſciences. That is not that</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Dagoucin) <hi>which I do mean; For he who loveth perfectly, will fear how he woundeth the honour of his Miſtreſſe; more than her ſelf: Therfore it ſeems to me, that a civil and a courteous anſwer, ſuch as a ſair and an honeſt love requireth, cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe Honour, and confirm the Conſcience; for he is no true Servant that doth deſire the contrary. This alwayes</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>is the end of your reaſons, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with Honour, and end in the contrary: And if thoſe Men who are here preſent would ſpeak the truth, I ſhould believe them without their Oaths.</hi> Hircan <hi>did ſwear, for his part, that he never loved any woman, his wiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, with whom he did not deſire to be a Sinner.</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montault <hi>ſaid as much, and added, That he had often
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119929:73"/>wiſhed that all wives in the world were pliant, &amp; eaſie to be gained, his own excepted.</hi> Gue bron <hi>ſaid unto him, Truly you do well deſerve that your own Wife were ſuch as you deſire others to be; but for my ſelf, I can juſtly ſwear, that I do ſo truly love one Lady, that I had rather die, than that for me ſhe ſhould ſuffer ſuch a change, that I ſhould eſteem her the leſſe afterwards; for my Love is ſo much groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on her virtues, that for all the good which in this world can arrive unto me, I would not ſee her in the leaſt ſort blemiſhed.</hi> Saffredant <hi>began to laugh, and did ſay unto him, I did think</hi> Guebron, <hi>that the love of your wife, and the good opinion that you have of her, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed you from being amorous of others, but I perceive it is not ſo: For you uſe the very ſame terms with which we are accuſtomed to deceive the most ſubtle, and to be heard by the moſt wiſeſt Ladies; for who are they will ſtop their ears when we ſhall begin with Honour and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: But if we did ſhow them our hearts, ſuch as indeed they are, there are many of us (who are bid very welcom amongſt Ladies) whom they would make afterwards no account of at all. We cover therefore our Devil with the beſt Angel that we can find out. And under that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before we are diſcovered, we receive gallant enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; And by this means we do ſo draw on the hearts of the Ladies, that they do think they do go in the direct way to virtue, and knowing afterwards the vice of the deceipt, it may be they have neither the means nor the leiſure to retreat. Truly ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>I took you for another Man than ſuch as you expreſſe your ſelf, and that Virtue was more agreeable to you than Pleaſure. How, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>Is not the greateſt virtue to love as God commandeth us? It ſeemeth to me to be far better done, to love a woman as a woman, than to idolize her, as divers others do. And as for my ſelf, I continue firm in that opinion, That it is better far to uſe them, than to abuſe them. The Ladies were all of</hi> Guebrons <hi>opinion, and conſtrained</hi> Saffiedant <hi>to hold his peace, who ſaid, I am well contented to ſpeak no more; for I have been ſo ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed amongſt them, that I have no mind to return
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119929:74"/>thither again. Your ſubtilty, and malice, ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>is the cauſe of our courſe entertainment of you, for what honeſt Lady is there who would maintain you for a Servant, after this Diſcourſe you have held with us? Some who do find me not ſo troubleſom</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>Will not exchange their honeſty for yours. But let us talk no more, that my choler may not be diſpleaſing to my ſelf, or to any one elſe. Let us obſerve to whom</hi> Dagoucin <hi>will give his voice, who ſaid; I give it unto</hi> Parlament; <hi>for I conceive that ſhe knows better than any other, what is that love which is moſt true and perfect.</hi> Parlament <hi>ſaid, Since I am choſen to give you an account, I will declare unto you a Hiſtory which happened to a Lady who hath been one of my greateſt friends, and the thought of whom is alwayes lodged in my memory.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The Third Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the Houſe of Madam the Regent Mother of King <hi>Francis,</hi> there was a very devout Gentlewoman, married to a Gentleman, who, as her ſelf, was piouſly affected. And although her Husband were old, and ſhe was beautifull and young, yet ſhe ſerved and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, as if he were the handſomeſt, and the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt man in the world. And to take away from him all occaſion of ſuſpition, ſhe attired her ſelf in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of an Old woman, and ſuitable to the age in which he was, and abandoned all Companies, Faſhions, Dances, and Playes, which young Ladies are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to frequent, and placed all her pleaſure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation in the Service of God. Wherefore her Husband did repoſe ſo great a love and truſt in her, that ſhe governed both his Houſe and himſelf at her
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119929:74"/>own pleaſure. It ſo fell out, that one day the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman told her, that from his Youth he had a great deſire to make a voyage to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> She who deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nothing more than to pleaſe him, ſaid unto him, Sweet-heart, Since God hath deprived us of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and beſtowed upon us wealth ſufficient, I would deſire you to ſet apart ſome quantity of it for ſo holy a voyage; for go where you will, thither, or elſwhere, I am reſolved to go with you, and never to abandon you. The good Man was ſo glad of it, that he thought he was already upon the Mount of <hi>Calvary.</hi> During this reſolution, there came a Gentleman to the Court, who had been often in the War againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> and beſought the aſſiſtance of the King of <hi>France</hi> in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize upon one of their Cities, by which he ſaid that great profit would redound to all Chriſtendom: The old Gentleman demanded of him his Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and after he underſtood his Reſolution, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, If after that voyage he would make another to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whither his Wife and himſelf had a great deſire to go. The Captain being very glad to hear their good deſires, did promiſe them to be a guide unto them in the way, and deſired him to keep the affair ſecret. The good old Gentleman thought the time long till he had found his wife, to give her an account of what he had done, who had as great a deſire to undertake the voiage as her Husband. And eftentimes on this occaſion, ſhe conferr'd with the Captain, who regarding her beauty more than her words, became ſo amorous, that ſpeaking to her of the voyages he had made upon the Seas, he would tel her of his imbarking at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> upon the <hi>Archipel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But he found her to be ſuch, that he durſt not ſpeak to her, nor make any Countenance of Love; And the concealing of his Love did beget ſuch a fire in his heart, that he oftentimes fell ſick, but the Gentlewoman was as carefull of him as of the Croſſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119929:75"/>it ſelf, &amp; circumſpect to guide her courſe: howſoever ſhe ſent many times to viſit him, by which he underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that ſhe had ſome reſpect unto him, did recover of himſelf, without any Phyſick at all. But divers Gentlemen obſerving this Captain, who had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be as gallant and brave a Man, as a good Chriſtian, did much wonder to ſee him ſo often to accoſt this Gentlewoman; and ſeeing that he had changed the condition of his life, and frequented al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the Churches, Sermons, and Confeſſions, they ſuſpected it was to obtain the favor of the young Gentlewoman, and could not refrain, but ſpoke ſome words unto him concerning that ſubject. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fearing that it might be brought unto her ear, did abſent himſelf from her company in publick, and told her Husband and her ſelf, That he ſhould ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be diſpatched at Court and be gone, and that he had many things to inform them with, but becauſe the Affair ſhould be kept ſecret, he would neither ſpeak with himſelf nor his Wife in publick, but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to ſend for him when they were in private both together. The Gentleman approved his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and failed not every night to go to bed betimes, and to make his Wife alſo to put off her cloaths to keep him Company: And when their Servants were departed from them, they ſent for the Captain, and conſulted on their voyage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the good old Man in great devotion talking of it, would often fall aſleep with the word <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his mouth. The Captain ſeeing the old Gentleman aſleep in his Bed, and himſelf in the Chair, and neer unto her whom he thought the moſt beautiful and moſt accompliſhed in the world, had his heart ſo locked up and beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with fear, and a deſire to ſpeak, that he often loſt his ſpeech. But to the end that ſhe might not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, he imployed himſelf to talk of the holy places in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where ſtill remained the ſignes of the great love which our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt did bear unto us; And in ſpeaking of that Love he cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119929:75"/>his own, looking on the young Gentlewoman with tears and ſighs, who perceived nothing at all. For obſerving his demure countenance, ſhe concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to be a grave and a pious man, and deſired him to acquaint her what was the courſe of life which he had lead, and how he did arrive to this Love of God. He declared unto her that he had been a poor Gentleman, who to purchaſe Riches and Honor had forgot his Conſcience, and eſpouſed a Wife too near allyed unto him, only becauſe ſhe was rich, and whom he could not love, being both old and ill-favoured. But having conſumed a great part of her Eſtate, he went to Sea to ſeek adventures there, and had thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo well by his endeavours, that he was become Maſter of a conſiderable Fortune: But ever ſince he was ſo happy to arrive unto the Knowledge of her ſelf, ſhe, by her Godly diſcourſe and good Examples, was the only Cauſe that he had changed his life, And all that he reſolved upon (if God ſhould return him in ſafety from his enter prize) was to be a Guide to her Husband and to her ſelf unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in ſome part for all his ſins, to which he had put a period, but only one ſin, which was, that as yet he had not given ſatisfaction to his Wife, to whom he hoped to be ſhortly reconciled. This diſcourſe did much pleaſe the Gentlewoman, but above all ſhe rejoyced that ſhe had drawn ſuch a Man to the love and the fear of God. Till the time of his departure from the Court he had with her every evening theſe long diſcourſes, and never offered to declare unto her his Intentions, he only preſented her with a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix, to which was annexed our Lady of Pity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her, that in his abſence looking on that, ſhe would call himſelf into her Memory. The hour of his departure being come, having taken his leave of her Husband, who immediately fell aſleep, he came to his Wife to give her a Farewell, and ſeeing tears in her eyes for the honeſt love ſhe did bear unto him, it did render his paſſion ſo inſupportable, that not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119929:76"/>daring to declare it, he did fall down in a ſwoun, bidding her Farewell in ſo great an agony and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that not only his eyes, but all his body did ſweat down tears. And without ſpeaking any more words, he departed, at which the Gentlewoman was much amazed, for ſhe never beheld any ſuch ſign of Grief before. Nevertheleſſe ſhe changed not the purpoſe of her good will towards him, and accompanied him with Prayers and Oriſons. At the end of one moneth, as this Gentlewoman one evening returned her to her Lodgings, there met her a Gentleman, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented her with a Letter from the Captain, deſiring her that ſhe would be pleaſed to read it by her ſelf, and told her that he ſaw him imbarqued, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go thorough with the enterpriſe, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the King, and the augmentation of the Faith; and for himſelf, that he was to return to <hi>Marſeilles</hi> to give order for the affairs of the Captain. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman retired to a Window by her ſelf, and did read the Letter all along, which contained two ſides, and much marvelled at the affection of the Captain, which ſhe never did ſuſpect; And obſerving that he had preſented her with a great and fair Diamond, the Ring wherein it was ſet being enameld with black, She was in a great perplexity what to do, and having troubled her ſelf all that night concerning it, ſhe was very glad that ſhe had no occaſion to write back unto him, or to return him any anſwer. Nor would ſhe fall out with the Meſſenger, thinking with her ſelf, that conſidering the pains he had taken for the ſervice of his Maſter, he had no need to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an ill anſwer; but ſhe reſolved to deliver it her ſelf unto him upon his return from his enterprize. Above all, ſhe was much perplexed with the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, for ſhe was not accuſtomed to dreſſe her ſelf at the expences of any other but her Husband; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being of a good underſtanding, ſhe deliberated with her ſelf to bring ſome profit by that Ring to the Conſcience of the Captain, and immediatly diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119929:76"/>one of her ſervants to the diſconſolate wife of the Captain, pretending her ſelf to be a religious woman of <hi>Taraſco,</hi> and did write unto her in theſe words, <hi>Madam, Monſieur your Husband paſſed this way a little before he took ſhipping, and after he had confeſſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sacrament as a good Chriſtian ought to do, he declared unto me one fault which lay heavy upon his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which was, the grief that he had not loved you ſo much as he ought to have done, and prayed and conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me at his departure to ſead you this Letter with this Diamond, which he deſireth you to keep for the Love you bear him; aſſuring you, That if God ſhall return him in ſafety, there was never any woman better uſed by a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, than you ſhall be by him, and this Diamond for the performance of it, ſhall be a firm pledge unto you of the aſſurance of his faith. I beſeech you to recommend him to God in your prayers, and he ſhall not want of mine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my life.</hi> This Letter, made up, and ſealed in the name of one of the Nuns of <hi>Taraſco,</hi> was ſent by the Gentlewoman to the Captains Wife; when the old woman beheld the Letter and the Ring, you need not demand how ſhe wept for joy and grief to be ſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and eſteemed of her Husband, of the ſight of whom ſhe ſaw her ſelf deprived. And kiſſing the Ring a thouſand times ſhe did bedew it with her tears, bleſſing God that at the end of her Dayes he had reſtored the love of her Husband to her, which ſhe held to be loſt for a long time. She alſo much than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Nun that was the Cauſe of her Good; To whom ſhe ſent the beſt anſwer that ſhe could, which the Meſſenger reported to his Miſtreſſe, who could neither read nor hear what her ſervant brought unto her from her, without laughing very heartily, and was well contented to be rid of the Diamond, to procure ſo great a good, as to eſtabliſh the Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Husband and the Wife, in doing which ſhe thought to her ſelf ſhe had gained a Kingdom. Not long after there arrived the News of the Defeat, and Death of the poor Captain, and how he was abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119929:77"/>by thoſe who ought to ſuccour him, and that his Enterpriſe was betrayed by the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> who moſt of all ſhould have kept it ſecret, inſomuch that himſelf and thoſe who landed with him, who were about the number of four and twenty, were killed upon the place; amongſt whom was a Gentleman called <hi>John,</hi> and a <hi>Turk</hi> whom the Gentleman above-ſpecified had anſwered for at the Fount, both whom ſhe had given to the Captain to attend upon him in his voyage, one whereof died with him, and the <hi>Turk</hi> being wounded with five arrows, did ſave himſelf by ſwimming to the <hi>French</hi> ſhips, by whom alone the Truth of this Defeat was underſtood: For a Gentleman whom the poor Captain had taken for a Friend and a Companion, and had advanced him into the favour of the King, and the greateſt of the Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as ever he ſaw the Captain landed, did retire back with the Ships into the Sea. The Captain ſeeing his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize diſcovered, and above Four thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> comming down upon him, would have retreated to the ſhips, as he ought to have done; but the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in whom he did repoſe his onely Confidence, knowing that in his Death the Charge and Command of the whole Army would be devolved upon himſelf, did declare unto the Gentlemen and others that were on ſhip-board, That they ought not to hazard the Veſſels of the King, nor ſo many good Souldiers that were in the ſhips, to ſave a few perſons only: By this perſwaſion they who of themſelves wanted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, did agree in opinion with him. The Captain obſerving, that the more he called upon them, the more they drew back towards the Main, and removed themſelves from his ſuccour, did return towards the <hi>Turks,</hi> being in Sands up to the knees, where he made ſuch demonſtrations of his Valour, and of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Arms, that it ſeemed that he alone was able to defeat all the numbers of his Enemies; by reaſon whereof his treacherous Companion entertained a greater fear, than a deſire of his Victory. At the laſt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119929:77"/>(whatſoever defence he could make) he received ſo many wounds by arrows from thoſe who durſt not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near unto him, that he began to loſe much bloud, and the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving the weakneſs of theſe poor Chriſtians, and ſcorning their unconſiderable numbers, did fall in upon them, and charged them with their Scemiters, which made deep cuts in their bodies, but as long as God gave them ſtrength and life, they defended themſelves, but that failing, the Captain called unto him the Gentleman whoſe Name was <hi>John,</hi> whom the Gentlewoman gave unto him, and the <hi>Turk,</hi> and ſticking the point of his Sword on the Sands, falling on his knees, he kiſſed and kiſſed again the Croſſe upon the hilts thereof, ſaying, Lord, Take into thy mercy the Soul of him who hath not ſpared his life to exalt thy name. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman whoſe name was <hi>John,</hi> perceiving that his life ended with thoſe words, embraced him, and the Croſſe on the hilt of the Sword which he had, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to have aſſiſted him, but a <hi>Turk</hi> behind him did give him a mortal blow with his Scemiter, who crying aloud, Let us go Captain, Let us go into Paradiſe to ſee him for whom we die, he was made the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Death, as he had been of the life of the poor Captain: The <hi>Turk</hi> ſeeing he could neither ſerve or fave either one or the other of them, being hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with five arrows, did flie to the ſhips, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to be received, although he was the only perſon that eſcaped of four and twenty, yet it was refuſed by the traiterous Companion of the Captain. But he who could ſwim well enough did throw himſelf into the Sea, and at laſt prevailed ſo far, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into a ſmall Veſſel, and in a few dayes cured of his wounds. And by this poor Stranger the truth of this Act was perfectly known, to the Honour of the Captain, and the Infamy of his Companion, whoſe offence the King, and all thoſe who ever heard of him, did judge to be ſo great, both againſt God and Men, that there was no death ſo grievous, but they thought
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:119929:78"/>he moſt juſtly did deſerve it. Howſoever at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Court, he made ſo many pretences, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, and gave ſuch great Preſents, that he was not only ſaved from puniſhment, but had the Command of the Captain conferred on him, whoſe Groom he was not worthy to be. When this News was firſt brought unto the Court, Madam the Regent Mother who highly did eſteem him, did wonderfully lament him, ſo did alſo the King, and all the perſonages of Honour about the Court: And ſhe whom too well he loved, hearing of his lamentable and Chriſtian death, changed the roughneſſe of her language with which ſhe thought to have entertained him at his return, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears and ſighes, in which her Husband did keep Company with her, being thus ſadly diſappointed of his hopes in his Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> I cannot here forget, That a Damoſel who lived with this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, whoſe Name was <hi>Joan,</hi> and loved the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that was given to the Captain better than the loved her ſelf, on the ſame morning that the Captain and the Gentleman were ſlain, did come unto her Miſtreſſe and told her, That ſhe had ſeen him in her ſleep laſt night whom ſo well ſhe loved, cloathed all in white, who was come unto her to take his Farewell of her, being on that day to go into Paradiſe with his Captain. But when ſhe found that her Dream was true, ſhe made ſo great a lamentation, that her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe had enough to do to comfort her. Some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths afterwards the Court removed into <hi>Normandy,</hi> of which Province the Captain was, whoſe Wife ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed to come to do Reverence to Madam the Mother Regent; And to be preſented to her, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her ſelf to that Gentlewoman whom her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſo much loved; And attending the hour in which they were to go unto the Church to hear Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens, the old woman began to praiſe and to lament her Husband, and amongſt other diſcourſes ſhe ſaid unto her, Madam, My misfortune is greater than ever did befall any woman; for juſt at the time that
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119929:78"/>he began to love me better than ever he did before, God took him from me. And ſpeaking thoſe words, ſhe ſhewed her the Ring which ſhe had upon her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as the token of his perfect love, which was not without many tears, at which the Lady (though ſhe was ſenſible enough of the old Womans grief) had ſo great a deſire to laugh, eſpecially ſince her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit produced this good, that ſhe was unable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her to Madam the Regent, but gave her to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and retired her ſelf into the Chapel, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laughed her fill, ſhe paſſed away the defire ſhe had to laugh any more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, It ſeems to me, that they unto whom ſuch gifts are preſented, ſhould deſire to do works that may come to ſo good an end, as this Gentlewoman did, for they only by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience do find, that good Deeds do redound to the joy of the Doers. And we ought not to accuſe this Gentlewoman of Deceit, but to eſteem of her good Intentions, who conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that into a Benefit, which of it ſelf is worth nothing. Will you ſay ſo (ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>Is a fair Diamond of two hundred Crowns price worth nothing? I dare aſſure you, that if it had fallen into my hands, neither his Wife nor any of his Kinred ſhould ever have ſeen it again. There is nothing better to any one ſelf than that which is given. The Captain was dead, No man knew any thing of it. Upon my word you have reaſon for it, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>for there are ſome women, who to ſhew themſelves more excellent than others, do ſome works apparently againſt their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for we all know well enough, that there is nothing more covetous than a woman; and yet their Glory doth oftentimes exceed their Avarice, which doth inforce their hearts to do thoſe things which they would not, And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that ſhe who forſook the Diamond was not worthy to wear it. Hola, Hola, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>I do ſuspect I know the Gentlewoman, I do beſeech you therfore, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn her before you ſee her. Madam, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>I do not condemn her; but if the Captain were as virtuous as you ſay he was, ſhe had been honoured to have had ſuch a Servant, and to have worn his Ring: but it may be that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119929:79"/>one leſſe worthy to be beloved, did take ſo faſt hold on her finger that his Ring could not come on. Truly ſaid</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, <hi>ſhe might well have kept it, becauſe there was not one who knew any thing of it. How is that, ſaid</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, <hi>Are all things lawfull to thoſe that love, becauſe no man knows of them? Take my word for it, ſaid</hi> Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredant, <hi>I never ſaw any miſ-deed puniſhed, but only foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs; for there is neither Murderer, Thief, nor Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer (but let him be as cunning as he is wicked) that was ever either condemned by Juſtice, or reproved amongſt Men, but oftentimes their ſubtilty is ſo great, that it doth blind them, ſo that they become fools, and (as I have ſaid) only the fools, and not the vicious, are puniſhed. You may ſpeak what you pleaſe, (ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can judge of the heart of that Lady, but as far as I can conjecture, I do find the Deed moſt honourable, and virtuous. And to debate no more upon it, I pray you</hi> Parlament <hi>to give your voice to ſome one. I give it moſt willingly, ſaid ſhe, to</hi> Simontault, <hi>for after theſe two ſad Novells, he will give us one, you may be ſure of it, that will not make us weep. I thank you (ſaid</hi> Simontault,) <hi>for in giving me your voice, you do not now (as lately) call me pleaſant, which is a word I love not, and to revenge myſelf on you, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that there are women who make a great appearance that they are wondrous chaſt to ſome, (and for a time) but the event doth ſhow them to be as they are, as you will find by this Story, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true.</hi>

                     </gap>umont</hi> was Governor, there was a Gentleman called <hi>Signior de Bonninet,</hi> who afterwards for his virtues was made Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> and was highly eſteemed at <hi>Milan</hi> by the great Maſter, and by all the world for the rare parts that were in him. He was often invited to the Banquets where the chiefeſt of the Ladies met, by whom he was better beloved than ever <hi>Frenchman</hi> was, as well for his Beauty, Gracefulneſſe, and Language, as for the great Name he had in Arms, being ſecond therein to none of his Time. One day being in a Mask, he did lead in the Dance one of the moſt brave, and moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ladies that were in that City, and when the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes ceaſed, he did alwayes diſcourſe unto her of Love, which he could better do than any other; but ſhe would make no anſwer to him, but oftentimes to interrupt him in his Diſcourſe, and to give a ſtop to his deſires, ſhe would aſſure him, That ſhe neither did, nor ever would love any but her Husband, and would by no means ſeem to underſtand him. At this anſwer this refuſed Gentleman would not deſiſt, and vigorouſly proſecuted his ſute untill the Middle of <hi>Lent.</hi> But for all his endeavours he found her firm in her reſolutions, neither to love him, nor any elſe, which he could hardly beleeve, ſeeing the hard fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and courſe deportment of her Husband, and the excellent beauty of her ſelf. He determined therefore with himſelf, ſince ſhe uſed diſſimulation, to practiſe the ſame art himſelf, and from that hour did forbear to Court he, and ſo narrowly enquired after
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119929:80"/>her converſation, that he found at laſt ſhe loved an <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman, who was very young, and wiſe, and lovely. <hi>Signior Bonninet</hi> by little and little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted himſelf with that Gentleman, with ſuch cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ſweetneſſe, that he perceived not the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Gentleman loved him ſo intirely, that next unto his Miſtreſſe, who was this Lady, there was not any in the world whom he tendred more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. <hi>Signior Bonninet,</hi> to pluck his ſecret from his heart, did counterfeit to tell him all his own, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, told him, That he loved ſuch a Lady, when indeed he ſcarce ever thought of her, and deſired him to keep it private, becauſe that they two had but one heart, and but one thought. The poor Gentleman to ſhew him a reciprocal Love, did declare unto him all along the affection which he did bear to that Dame, on whoſe diſdain <hi>Bonninet</hi> would revenge himſelf; Once a day they met together, to acquaint one another with the fortunes which on that day they incounter'd, which the Gentleman did in Truth, and the other in Diſſimulation. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman confeſſed unto him, That he had loved this Lady three years, without receiving any thing but good words from her, and an aſſurance to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>Bonninet</hi> did counſel and inſtruct him in all the ways that poſſibly he could, by which he might ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the fruition of his Deſires, which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man found ſo effectual, that in a few dayes ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to all that he deſired, there nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but to find out the opportunity, which by the means of <hi>Signior Bonninet</hi> was brought about. One day a little before Supper, the Gentleman ſaid unto him, I am more obliged to you, than to all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the world; for by your good Directions I hope to enjoy that this night, which ſo many years I have deſired. I pray you, ſaid <hi>Bonninet,</hi> tell me the manner of your enterprize, to ſee if there be any deceit or danger in it; that I may aſſiſt, and ſerve you, according to the obligations of our friendſhip.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119929:80"/>Whereupon the Gentleman did particularly account unto him, that the Lady had got the opportunity to have the great gate of her Houſe left open, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an Infirmity which one of her Brothers had, by reaſon whereof every hour in the night they muſt ſend into the City, to help him with ſome remedy in his neceſſities, ſhe informed him that he might ſafely come into the Court, but adviſed him to have a care how he went up the ſtairs, and that he might more ſafely paſſe another way, and on leſſe ſtairs, which were on the right hand; and that being come into the firſt gallery, where were the chambers of her Father-in-law, and her Brother-in-law, he ſhould come to the third Chamber next to the little ſtairs, and (knocking at the door gently) if he ſhould find it latched, that then he ſhould be gone, for he might aſſure himſelf that her Husband was come home, but if he found the door open, that he ſhould ſoftly come in and latch the door faſt, being confident that there was none in the Chamber but her ſelf; and above all things, that he ſhould not forget to come to her with ſhooes made of Felt, for fear of making a noiſe; and withall, that he ſhould have a great care that he came not till two of the clock after Midnight, becauſe her Brothers-in-law, who were much given to play, did ſeldome go to bed till after one. <hi>Bonninet</hi> ſaid unto him, Go my Friend, God be thy guide, whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech to guard thee from all Inconveniences, if my Company may do thee any good, I will not ſpare any thing that lies in my power. The Gentleman did thank him very heartily, and told him, That in that affair he could not be too ſecure, and that he would go to prepare himſelf. But <hi>Signior Bonninet</hi> would not hear on that ear; and ſeeing it was the only hour to revenge himſelf on that cruel Lady, he retired to his own Lodging betimes, and cauſed his beard to be cut after the ſame length and largeneſſe as was the Gentlemans; he alſo commanded in the ſame manner the hair of his head to be cut, that by her
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:119929:81"/>touch ſhe might not find any difference. He did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo the ſhooes of Felt, and did put on ſuch cloaths as were moſt like unto thoſe which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was accuſtomed to wear when he would be moſt gallant. And becauſe he was very well beloved by the Father-in-law of the Lady, he feared not to go thither before the appointed hour; conceiving with himſelf, that if he was perceived, he would go direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Chamber, with whom he had ſome buſineſſe. About twelve of the clock he came into the Houſe, where he found many ſervants, and ſome others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and going, amongſt whom he paſſed without being known, and came into the gallery. And thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting againſt the two firſt doors he found them ſhut, but the third not, having ſoftly knocked at which, he entred into it, and having latched faſt the door, he found all the Chamber hung with white Linnen, and the floor and the feeling with the ſame, and a bed of Needlework excellently wrought all in white, that it was impoſſible to have it better, and the Lady alone within it, having on a moſt rich Coyf, and a Smock all covered with pearls and precious ſtones, which he ſaw through one corner of the Curtain, being not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf perceived by her, for there was burning in the Chamber a great Candle of white W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x, which made the Chamber as bright as day. And for fear he ſhould be known by her, he firſt of all put out the light which was burning in the Chamber, afterwards he put off his cloaths, and came into the bed to her, who thinking it was he whom ſo long ſhe loved, did receive him with all the Love that poſſibly ſhe could. But he who knew well enough that it was in the Name of another, did not ſpeak one word, and thought on nothing but thoroughly to put his venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance into execution, which was to take away from her her honour and her chaſtity againſt her will.</p>
               <p>But the Lady was ſo well contented with that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, that ſhe thought ſhe had recompenced him for his long ſufferings. The clock had now ſtruck
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:119929:81"/>one, which was the time to bid her Farewel; And ſpeaking to her as ſoftly as he could, he asked her, If ſhe was as well contented with him, as he was with her. She thinking that it was her Friend, made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That ſhe was not only contented, but alſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at the greatneſſe of his Love, which had held him a whole hour without ſpeaking to her. At that he began to laugh outright, and ſaid unto her, Now Madam will you refuſe me another time, as you have been accuſtomed to do, untill this preſent. She know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him too late, both by his laughter and his voice, was ſtrook into an amazement with the ſhame ſhe had brought upon her ſelf, and called him a thouſand times wicked Traytor, and Impoſtor, and would have thrown her ſelf out of the Bed to look out a knife to have killed her ſelf, becauſe ſhe was ſo unfortunate to have loſt her Honour with one whom ſhe loved not, and who, to be revenged of her, might divulge her ſhame throughout the world. But he held her in his arms, and by ſweet words did aſſure her, That he loved her more than he did whom ſhe loved, and that he would conceal that which touched her Honour, that ſhe never ſhould receive the leaſt diſcredit, which the poor Lady believed, and underſtanding the Invention which he had contrived to obtain her, and the difficulties he went through to accompliſh it, ſhe did ſwear unto him, That ſhe did love him better than the other, who knew not how to conceal a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: And moreover, whereas there was a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port raiſed on the <hi>French,</hi> ſhe now knew to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and that they were more wiſe, conſtant, and diſcreet, than the <hi>Italians,</hi> wherefore ſhe would now differ from the opinion of her own Nation, to comply with them. But ſhe did heartily entreat him, that for a time he would forbear to appear at any Feaſt or Meeting where ſhe was, unleſſe it were a Mask only, for ſhe knew well enough that ſhe ſhould have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bluſhes upon her cheeks, that her Countenance would declare it to all the world. This he promiſed
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119929:82"/>to perform, and alſo entreated her, That when his Friend ſhould come about two hours hence, that ſhe would make him good cheer, and by little and little withdraw her ſelf from him. Of which ſhe made a great difficulty, but becauſe it was his deſire, ſhe at laſt conſented to it. And taking his Farewel of her, he did leave her ſo ſatisfied, that ſhe could have been well contented to have had him to have ſtayed lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with her. After that he roſe, and had dreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he made haſt out of the Chamber, and left the door half ſhut, and half open, as he found it: And becauſe it was almoſt two a-clock after midnight, he entertained a fear that he ſhould find the Gentleman in the way, he retired himſelf a little into a private corner on the top of the ſtairs, where not long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he obſerved the Gentleman to paſſe by, and to enter into the Ladies Chamber, whereupon he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf repaired directly to his own Lodging, to take ſome repoſe after his nights travels, which he did, and did not riſe untill it was paſt nine of the clock in the morning, at what time the Gentleman came to him, who never failed to give him an account of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which was not now ſo good as he hoped it would have proved; For he told him, That when he came into the Chamber of the Lady, he found her out of Bed, and in her Night-gown, having a great Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on her, her pulſe beating very violently, her face all on fire, and a great ſweat running down her face; wherefore ſhe did immediatly intreat him to return from whence he came, for fear that ſhe ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to call unto her Maids to come to her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo violent was her diſtemper, inſomuch ſhe ſaid, that ſhe had more need to think of Death, than Love, and to talk rather of God, than of <hi>Cupid.</hi> Howſoever ſhe was very ſorry for the hazard into which he had put himſelf for the love of her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had no power to make him in this world any requital for his true love, being ready to be gone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another. At this he was ſo ſad, and ſo aſtoniſhed,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:119929:82"/>that his Fire and his Joy were converted into Ice and Sorrow, and ſo immediatly he departed. In the morning, on the break of Day, he ſent to be more ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed of her health, and found for certain, that ſhe was in an extreme Indiſpoſition, and multiplying his complaints for her, he wept ſo abundantly, that it ſeemed his Soul was comming out with his tears. <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninet,</hi> who had as great a deſire to laugh, as the other to weep, did comfort him the beſt that poſſibly he could, and told him, That things of a long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, did alwayes meet with an untoward beginning, and that Love did a little draw back, but to come on with the greater force, and to make the Delight more gratefull. And on theſe words they departed.</p>
               <p>The Lady for a certain time did keep her Bed, and on the recovery of her health, ſhe bid Adieu to her firſt Servant, and grounded it on the fear which ſhe had of Death, and the Remorſe of her Conſcience, and continued her familiarities with <hi>Signior Boninet,</hi> the continuation of whoſe Love (according to the Cuſtom) was as the Beauty of the Flowers of the Fields.</p>

You may ſpeak what you will of women,</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>but that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man acted a wicked part; for ſuppoſe the Lady had a Friend, muſt another circumvent him by his policy? You may aſsure your ſelf, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>that ſuch Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes can never be better ſold, but to thoſe that offer moſt, and to thoſe Buyers who come laſt, and give the greateſt price: Never believe, that thoſe who in this nature do court Ladies, do endure any great pain for the love of them, No, no, it is only for the love of themſelves, and for their own pleaſures. On my credit, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>I do believe you, for to declare the truth unto you, all thoſe Gentlemen which ever yet courted me, began all their Complements on my behalf, pretending to deſire my Life,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119929:83"/>my Good, my Honor, but the end was only for themſelves, and for their own pleaſure, and their own glory; therefore it is the ſafeſt courſe to take leave of them at the firſt part of their Sermon, for when we come to the ſecond, it is not ſo much honour to refuſe them, ſeeing that Vice when it is once known, is refuſable of it ſelf. It behooveth then, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that as ſoon as ever a Man doth begin to open his mouth, we muſt refuſe him, without knowing what he would ſay.</hi> Parlament <hi>anſwered, My Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, you muſt not underſtand it ſo, for you know well, that at the firſt words a Lady ſhould not ſeem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any thing, neither after he hath declared himſelf ſhould ſhe much leſſe believe him, but when he comes to ſwear, and adde oath unto oath, it ſeems to me that it is the beſt courſe for a Lady to forſake him then at his clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of the Hill, before he hath have to come down unto the Valley.

               <head>A Lady of the Kings Court perceiving her ſelf diſdained by her Husband, who made love to another, did by the like love revenge her ſelf.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Fifth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the Court of King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, there was a Gentleman whoſe name I know ſo well, that I will not here give it to you. He was but poor, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving hardly five hundred Livres in yearly Rents, but ſo beloved of the King for the virtues with which he was accompliſhed, that by his means he eſpouſed ſo rich a Lady, that a great Lord might well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her fortunes. And becauſe ſhe was not yet of age for a husband, he entreated one of the greateſt Ladies of the Court to take her to her, which very willingly ſhe accorded to. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ſo courteous, and ſo lovely, that all the Ladies of this Court did very much eſteem him, and amongſt others, one whom the King loved, who was not ſo young nor ſo beautifull as his own wife, and for the great love which he did bear unto this Lady, he did make ſo ſmall an accompt of his own wife, that he hardly lay with her one night in a whole year; and which was more grievous to her, he would never ſo much as ſpeak unto her, nor ſhew her the leaſt ſign of love. And although he ranted it with her Eſtate, he allowed her ſo ſmall a part out
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119929:84"/>of it, that ſhe was not apparelled as pertained to a Gentlewoman of her birth, nor as ſhe deſired: whereupon the Lady with whom ſhe was, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes reprove the Gentleman, telling him, your wife is fair, rich, and of a great deſcent, and you make no reckoning of her, which her infancy and youth hath yet endured, but I am afraid, that when ſhe ſhall behold her ſelf fair and great, that her glaſſe, and ſome one who loves you not, will remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate her beauties to her ſo little eſteemed by you, and ſhe may by deſpight do that, which ſhe durſt not doe if ſhe were aſſured of your love. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who had his heart elſewhere, did but laugh at her, and for all her inſtructions did not forbear to continue that courſe of life he led. But after the ſpace of two years or thereabouts, his wife began to be one of the moſt handſome Ladies in all <hi>France,</hi> inſomuch that ſhe was accounted the Non-pareill of the Court; and the more worthy ſhe perceived her ſelf to be beloved, the more ſhe grieved to ſee her Husband to make no reckoning of her, inſomuch that ſhe contracted ſo great a melancholly, that for all the exhortations of the Lady with whom ſhe lived, ſhe ſeemed to be a creature given up to deſpair. And having ſtudied all the means that poſſibly ſhe could to be complacent to her Husband, ſhe thought with her ſelf, that it was impoſſible for him to love her, ſeeing ſhe loved him ſo entirely, and could not find out any reaſon to be given for it, unleſſe he were in love with ſome one elſe, and entertained ſome other fancy in his apprehenſion, which ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after with ſo much ſubtilty, and dexterity of Circumſpection, that ſhe found out the truth, and that every night he was ſo taken up in courting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lady, that he forgot his Conſcience, and his Wife: And after ſhe was certain of the life he did lead, ſhe ſo wholly abandoned her ſelf to grief, that ſhe cloathed her ſelf all in black, and would not reſort to any Feaſts or Sports, which the Lady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119929:84"/>with whom ſhe lived, and did what ſhe could to withdraw her from her melancholly thoughts, but it was not poſſible for her, and although her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was often advertiſed of it, he was more ready to encreaſe than to redreſſe her ſorrows. You know Ladies, that Grief foregoeth Joy, and alſo that Grief by Joy doth come to an end. Wherfore it fell out upon a day, that a great Lord, a near kinſman to the Lady who was as a Guardian to this Gentlewoman, &amp; often did frequent the houſe, having underſtood of the ſtrange manner of life of this yong Gentlewoman with her husband, taking pity of her, did endeavor to comfort her, &amp; in diſcourſing with her, he found her ſo wiſe, &amp; lovely, that he deſired to have a place in her affection far more than to diſcourſe with her of her husband, unles it were to demonſtrate to her the ſmall occaſion ſhe had to love him. This young Lady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her ſelf forſaken of him who ought to love her, and on the other ſide to be loved and courted by ſo great and gallant a Prince, did conceive her ſelf thrice happy to be entertained in his good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And although ſhe had alwayes a great deſire to preſerve her honour, yet ſhe took ſo great a pleaſure to diſcourſe with him, and to perceive her ſelf to be beloved by him, that ſhe was noted for it. This love continued a certain time, until the King himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, who eſteemed ſo well of the Gent. that he would not permit that any diſhonour ſhould accrew unto him; Wherefore he very earneſtly entreated the Prince, to remove his love from her, and told, that if he did ſtill continue it he ſhould be very ill pleaſed at it. The Pr. who preferred the favor of the. K. to all the beauties of the Ladies of the world, did promiſe him that in obedience to his commands he would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his enterpriſe, and on that Evening he would take his leave of her, which he did, when ever he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſhe was retir'd into her lodgings, over which were the lodgings of her Husband; and being that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the window, he perceived the Prince to enter
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119929:85"/>into the Chamber of his Wife, which was under his own, but the Prince, who obſerved him well enough, did not deſiſt to go to her, And bidding her Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, whoſe love was but on the beginning, he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege unto her all the reaſons and commandements of the King; After many tears, and ſorrows, which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted until an hour after Midnight, the young Lady ſaid unto him in the concluſion, Sir, I give thanks to God, that he hath been pleaſed that you ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear your affection, ſeeing it is ſo little and ſo weak, that you can take it and leave it at the commandment of Men. As for my ſelf, I have not demanded coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel either of my Guardian, or of my Husband, or of my Self, to love you; for Love, ayded by the deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your fair ſelf, and by your civilities, hath had ſo much power on me, that I have not acknowledged any other God, or King, but him only. And ſince your heart is not filled with ſuch true Love, but Fear doth find a place within it, you cannot be a perfect Friend, and one that is imperfect ſhall never be a Friend of mine. For I loved perfectly, as I reſolved with my ſelf to love you, and I am conſtrained to bid Adieu unto you, whole tame fear doth not deſerve the height and courage of my love. In this manner the Prince departed weeping, and looking back, obſerved her Husband ſtill looking out at the window, who did obſerve both his comming in, and his going out. Wherefore on the next morning he did give him an account of the reaſon wherefore he did repair to his Wife, and told him the Commandment which the King had laid upon him; with which the Gentleman was much contented, and moſt humbly thanked the King. But obſerving that every day his Wife did grow more fair than other, and that he himſelf became old, and was much altered in his Complexion, he did begin to change his mind, and to leave her for whom he had diſdained his Wife, and now to make much of his Wife only; But ſhe, the more ſhe ſaw him to affect her, the more ſhe fled from him, reſolving to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119929:85"/>return him part of thoſe pangs that ſhe endured, for being ſo little beloved by him: And to take away the pleaſure which Love had begun to poſſeſſe him with, ſhe addreſſed her ſelf to a young Gentleman, ſo gracefull, lovely, and well-ſpoken, that he was belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all the Ladies of the Court; and making her complaints unto him how ſhe had been uſed by her Husband, ſhe did incite him to take pity on her, ſo that this young Gentleman omitted nothing that might bring comfort to her, and ſhe to recompence her ſelf for the loſſe of the Prince, who had forſaken her, did endeavour her ſelf to love this Gentleman ſo entirely, that ſhe forgot all her paſt affliction, and thought on nothing, but ſo to carry on this n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w love that it might not be diſcovered. Which ſhe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſuch dexterity, that her Guardian percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nothing of it; for in her preſence ſhe took great care how ſhe did ſpeak unto him: but when ſhe would hold any Conference in private with him, ſhe would pretend to go to give a viſit to ſome Ladies at the Court, amongſt whom there was one of whom her Husband would ſeem to be in love. One night after Supper, when it was very dark, this young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman ſtole away without calling any one to keep her company, and came into the Preſence Chamber, where all the Ladies were, where ſhe found him whom ſhe loved far better than ſhe loved her ſelf, and ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cloſe by him, ſhe leaning on a Table did talk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, feigning as if ſhe had read on ſome book. One whom her Husband had imployed to watch her, did in great haſt report unto him where his Wife was, and in whoſe Company; he who was a knowing man, made all the haſt he could unto her, and comming into the Chamber did behold his Wife reading of a Book, and ſeemed not to ſee her, but directed his courſe to the Ladies, to diſcourſe with them who were on the other ſide of the Chamber. This poor young Lady perceiving that her Husband had found her with him, with whom ſhe never entertained the leaſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119929:86"/>diſcourſe before him, was ſo amazed, that for a little while ſhe loſt her ſenſe, and being to go all along by the Bench, ſhe took her courſe quite croſſe the room at the tables-end, and ran away as if her Husband had purſued her with a naked ſword; ſhe did run to the Lodgings of her Guardian, whom ſhe found going to bed, and when ſhe had put off her cloaths, ſhe left her, and retired to her own Chamber, whither one of her Maids came unto her, and told her, That her Husband would ſpeak with her. She anſwered her very reſolutely, that ſhe would not go to him, and that he was of ſo ſtrange, and violent a Temper, that ſhe was afraid he would do her ſome Injury. At the laſt, for fear of worſe, ſhe did go to him, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band did not ſpeak ſo much as one word to her, untill they were in Bed together. She who could diſſemble as well as himſelf, began very tenderly to weep; and when he demanded of her the occaſion of her tears, ſhe told him, That ſhe was afraid that he was angry with her, becauſe he found her reading in a Book with a Gentleman. Immediatly he did aſſure her, That he never did forbid her to ſpeak to any Man, and that he was not angry that he found her ſpeaking with him, but becauſe ſhe fled away ſo faſt, as if ſhe had done ſomething worthy of Reproof, and that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that running away he had a ſuſpition that ſhe loved the Gentleman. Wherefore he did now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid her to ſpeak with any man in publick or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, aſſuring her, That the firſt time he ſhould take her ſpeaking to any Man, he would kill her, without conſideration or compaſſion. Which ſhe willingly accepted, being reſolved with her ſelf not to be ſo ſottiſh as to be taken again. But becauſe that in things to which we have a deſire, the more we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, the more violently we ſeek them; This poor Lady not long after did forget thoſe threatnings of her Husband; for on the very next Evening, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to lie in another Chamber with other young Ladies, ſhe ſent to ſeek out the Gentleman,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119929:86"/>and to requeſt him, that he would come and ſee her that night. But her Husband, who was ſo tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with jealous pangs that he could not ſleep, did riſe in the night, and took one of his Grooms with him, becauſe he heard that ſomebody elſe was ſent for, and knocked at the Door of his Wives Chamber. She who thought of no man leſſe than himſelf, did riſe, being alone, and took her petticoat, and her night-gown, that was next to her hand, and ſeeing that three or four of her Maids were all aſleep, ſhe did go to the Chamber door, and asking who was there? ſhe was anſwered by his Name whom ſhe had ſent for, and whom ſo paſſionately ſhe loved, but (to be more aſſured) ſhe opened the little Wicket, ſaying, If you are he that you do ſay you are, give me your hand, I ſhall readily know it. And when ſhe had taken her Husband by the hand, ſhe immediatly knew him, and ſhutting ſuddenly the Wicket, ſhe began to cry out, Ah <hi>Monſieur,</hi> It is your hand. Her Husband did anſwer her in a great Rage, It is the ſame hand which is the pledge of the love and promiſes betwixt us, wherefore fail not to come when I ſhall ſend for you. And ſpeaking thoſe words he departed to his Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſhe returned into her Chamber rather dead than alive, and ſpake aloud unto her Women, Riſe my Friends, you have ſlept too much for me; for in thinking to deceive you, I have been deceived, firſt of all, my ſelf. And ſpeaking thoſe words ſhe ſwou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away in the middle of the Chamber. The poor women did all riſe at her cry, ſo aſtoniſhed to ſee their Miſtreſſe, as dead, and lying on the ground, and to hear thoſe words ſhe did ſpeak, that they knew not what to do, but only to run for Remedies to revive her; And when ſhe had recovered ſpeech, ſhe ſaid unto them, This Hour you ſee me, my friends, the moſt unfortunate creature upon the Earth, and repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them all her fortune, deſiring them to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to perform their laſt ſervice to her, for ſhe reckned her life as loſt. They indeavouring to comfort her,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119929:87"/>behold one of the Grooms of her Husbands Chamber, by whom he commanded to acquaint her inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to repair unto him. She embracing two of her women, began to weep, and to lament, deſiring them that that they would not let her go, for ſhe was ſure never to return again. But the Groom of the Chamber aſſured her to the contrary, and that upon the hazard of his own life he would undertake that ſhe ſhould receive no Ill. She ſeeing that there was no reſiſtance, did put her ſelf into the arms of the Groom, and ſaid unto him, Friend, Since it muſt be ſo, carry this unhappy body unto Death, and being overcome with ſorrow, ſhe was carried away by the Groom into his Maſters Lodging, at whoſe feet the poor Lady trembled down, ſaying, Sir, I beſeech you to have pity on me, and I will ſwear unto you by the faith which I owe to God that I will tell you the truth of all. Immediatly he ſaid unto her as a Man tranſported, And I vow unto you, you ſhall tell me the truth of all, and on thoſe words commanded all his Servants to be gon. And becauſe he knew his wife to be religious, he believed that ſhe would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwear her ſelf, if ſhe did ſwear upon the Croſſe, wherefore he brought her a very fair one which he had borrowed, and there being none preſent but themſelves, he made her ſwear upon the Croſſe, that ſhe ſhould tell him the plain truth of that which he demanded: But ſhe who had already paſſed over the firſt apprehenſions of Death, took heart, and reſolved with her ſelf to conceal nothing from him, ſeeing ſhe was to die, but ſo, as not to reveal any thing that might bring any danger to the Gentleman whom ſhe loved. And having heard divers queſtions which he made unto her, ſhe made anſwer, Sir, I will not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſie my ſelf, nor make leſſe unto you the Love which I have born unto the Gentleman, of whom you have ſuſpition; but I have a deſire to acquaint you with the occaſion of that Love. Sir, you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that never any Woman did love her Husband
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119929:87"/>with ſuch an entire affection as I have loved you, for ſince I have been firſt married to you, there never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into my heart the love of any but of your ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; you know that in my Nonage, my Parents would have married me to a perſonage of a far nobler Family than your ſelf, but they could never make me give the leaſt conſent unto it, from the hour that you firſt ſpake unto me; for I ſtood moſt firm againſt their perſwaſions for you, without regarding your poverty, or the Remonſtrances which they made. And you cannot be ignorant of the hard uſe which ever ſince I have received from you, and how you have loved and eſteemed me, which hath brought ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and affliction on me, that had it not been for the Lady under whoſe Government you did put me, I had been ſunk into the Bottom of Deſpair. But in the end, obſerving my ſelf to grow into Age, and to be eſteemed to be beautiful by all the world, but your ſelf, I began ſo vigorouſly to feel the Injury which you did me, that the love I did bear unto you was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into hatred, and the Deſire to pleaſe you, into vengeance. And in that reſolution, a Prince cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, who, to obey his King more than his Love, did love me on the ſame time, when I began to feel ſome comfort and releaſment from my torments by the honeſt love I did bear unto him. And in leaving him, I found this Gentleman, who needed not to be intreated to love me. Howſoever, his Beauty, his ſweet Deportment, and his Virtue, did deſerve to be ſought after, and eſteemed by all women of a good underſtanding. At my requeſt, and not his own, he loved me, and with ſo much honeſty, that never in his life he required any thing of me contrary to honour. And becauſe the little love which I have cauſe to bear unto you, did give me the occaſion to keep neither faith nor loyalty with you, yet the love which I do bear unto God alone, and to my honour, hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to preſerved me from doing any thing, for which I ſhould either ſtand in need of Confeſſion, or of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:119929:88"/>fear of ſhame. I will not deny unto you, that as often poſſibly I could, I have gone to ſpeak with him in a Wardrobe, pretending to go to my Devotions; for I never truſted either Man or Woman for the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of that affair. I will not moreover deny, but that (being in a place ſo private, and free from all ſuſpition,) I have kiſſed him with a better heart than ever I kiſſed you; but I deſire no mercy of God, if there were ever any other familiarities betwixt us, or if ever he ſollicited me for other by any hot Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, or if ever my own heart had any deſire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, although I was ſo glad to ſee him, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me that I could have no greater pleaſure nor happineſſe in the world. And you Sir, who are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Cauſe of my misfortune, will you take vengeance for a Deed, which (for ſo long a time) you have given me the Example? an Example which hath out-gon me in this, that what you have done hath been without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp; without conſcience. For you know, &amp; I know well enough, that ſhe whom you do love, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her ſelf with that which God and Reaſon do command. And although the Laws of Men doe give ſo great a diſhonour to Women who do love other Men beſides their Husbands, yet the Law of God doth not except the Husbands, who love others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Wives. And if you will put into the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance your offence, and the offence which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; You are a Man wiſe, and experienced, and of age to know, and to be able to eſchew Evil; I am but young, and without any experience of the force and tyranny of Love. You have a Wife that doth cheriſh, eſteem, and love you better than her own life; and I have a Husband that doth eſchew, hate, and diſdain me more than a Servant. You love a Woman that is grown into a great age, diſcomplexio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and nothing ſo handſom as my ſelf; and I love a Gentleman far younger than your ſelf, and more lovely and delightfull. You love a Woman that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to one of the greateſt Friends that you have in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119929:88"/>the world, tranſgreſſing on the one ſide the love, &amp; on the other ſide the Reverence which you ſhould carry to them both; and I love a young Gentleman, who is tied in no obligation, but only of his love to me. Now judge Sir, and be impartial in your Judgment, which of us two are moſt to be puniſhed, either you, or my ſelf; I believe there is no man that is either wiſe or honeſt, but will lay all the blame on you, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I am but young and ignorant, deſpiſed and contemned by you, and beloved by the moſt courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the handſomeſt Gentleman in all <hi>France,</hi> whom I do love, by a deſpair only that I ſhall never be beloved by you.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman hearing her words full of truth, and ſpoken and pronounced with ſo aſſured a grace that ſhe ſhewed that ſhe neither feared nor deſerved any puniſhment, did find himſelf ſo ſurpriſed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he knew not what to reply unto her, but only, that the honour of a Woman, and of a Man, were not alike, but differed in ſeveral reſpects: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, becauſe ſhe did ſwear, That there was no ſin committed betwixt her, and the Gentleman whom ſhe loved, he was reſolved to make much of her, upon a condition that ſhe would return no more unto him, and that he for his part would abandon her whom he had loved; and that neither he nor ſhe for the time to come ſhould call to mind any thing that had paſſed betwixt them, which was promiſed on both ſides, and ſo in good accordance they went to bed together. In the morning one of the young Ladies old Maids, who had a great fear of the life of her Miſtreſſe, did come early to her riſing, and ſaid unto her, And well Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, how goes it with you now? She laughing, made anſwer, Why my Friend, there is not a better Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in the world than mine, for he believed what I did ſwear. In this manner ſhe continued five or ſix dayes, and the Gentleman did keep ſo cloſe a guard upon her, that ſhe was watched both night and day; but he could not watch her ſo narrowly, but that ſhe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:119929:89"/>would ſtill in one obſcure place or other hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with him whom ſhe loved. But ſhe carried her affairs ſo privately, that neither Man nor Woman could ever diſcover the truth; and had not one of the Grooms reported, that he had ſeen a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a Lady together in a Cloſet, under the Chamber of the Lady that was Guardian to this young Gentlewoman, the ſuſpition had ceaſed; the doubt whereof did ſo torment this Gentleman, that he was reſolved to be the Death of the yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and aſſembled a great number of his Friends and Confidents together to kill him whereſoever they ſhould find him; but the chiefeſt of his Friends in this confederacy was ſo much a friend to the young Man whoſe life was ſought after, that inſtead of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing him, he did advertiſe him of all things that were contrived againſt him: And he was ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved at the Court, and ſo well accompanied, that he feared not all the force of his Enemies, which was the reaſon that they could never find the opportunity to exerciſe their vengeance on him. But it ſo fell out not long after that he did meet in a Church with the Guardian of the young Lady whom he loved, who knew nothing at all of any thing that had paſſed, for before her ſelf he never durſt ſpeak unto her.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman made report unto her of the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the ill will which the Husband did bear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and although that he was innocent, he was reſolved to make a long voyage to take away the Report, which began to increaſe. This Lady that was Guardian to his Miſtreſſe, was much amazed to hear thoſe words, and did proteſt unto him, that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band did commit an unpardonable offence, to ſuſpect a Lady of Honour, in whom ſhe never knew nor ſaw any thing but Honeſty, and Virtue. Nevertheleſſe by reaſon of the Authority in which the Husband was, and to ſtop the current of this falſe Report, the Princeſſe adviſed him to abſent himſelf for a time, and aſſured him, that ſhe believed not any thing of al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:119929:89"/>theſe follies and ſuſpitions. The young Gentleman was very glad that he continued in the favour and good opinion of the old Lady, who adviſed the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, before his departure, to ſpeak unto the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the young Gentlewoman, which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her counſel, and found him in the gallery hard by the Chamber of the King, where with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured countenance he ſaid unto him. Sir, I have had all my life a deſire to ſerve you, and for a recompence for it, I underſtand that this night you have a deſign to ſeek me out to kill me. Sir, I beſeech you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that although you have more authority and power than my ſelf, yet that I am a Gentleman as well as your ſelf, and it would grieve me to fling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life for nothing. I muſt beſeech you alſo to conſider, that you have a moſt virtuous Lady to your Wife, and if there be any that will ſpeak to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, I will tell him, that he lies like a Vilain. And for my ſelf, I thought I had not done any thing to give you an occaſion to wiſh me evil; if you pleaſe I will continue your ſervant; if not, I am a ſervant of the Kings, for which I have reaſon enough to content my ſelf. The Gentleman to whom he addreſſed this Diſcourſe, made anſwer, That true it was he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome ſuſpition of him, but he found him ſo good a Man, that he deſired rather to have his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than his enmity, and bidding him Farewel (with Hat in hand) he embraced him as one of his faſteſt friends. You may think with your ſelves what thoſe men thought, who on the Evening before had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Commiſſion to kill him, when they ſaw ſuch ſigns of Honour, and of a familiar Love. In this manner the Gentleman departed, who becauſe he was not ſo well furniſhed with Silver, as with gallant qualities, the young Lady gave him a Ring that was worth three thouſand Crowns, which he morgaged for fifteen hundred. And not long after his departure, the Gentleman (Husband to the young Lady) came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Guardian, and beſought her to give his Wife
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:119929:90"/>leave to go for a certain time to a Siſter of his to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with her, which the old Lady thought very ſtrange, and beſought him to acquaint her with the occaſion of it, part whereof he did impart unto her, but not all. After that the young marryed Lady had taken leave of her Guardian, and of all the Court, without any tears at all, or the leaſt ſign of grief, ſhe travelled to that place which her Husband did aſſign her, and was conducted by a Gentleman, to whom an expreſſe charge was given to keep a ſtrict watch over her, and above all things, that on the way he ſhould not ſpeak unto her, who was ſuſpected to love her too familiarly. She who underſtood the Commandment of her Husband, did give them alarms every day, and laughed at them, and at their too officious Care. One day amongſt the reſt, juſt at her departure from the Inne, ſhe found a Frier on horſeback, and ſhe being mounted on an ambling Nagg, did hold him in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe from Dinner untill Supper, and when ſhe was about a mile from the place where ſhe was to lodge, ſhe ſaid unto him, Good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the conſolations which you have given me this afternoon, behold two Crowns which here I give you, and have put them in this Paper, becauſe I know that you dare not touch them with a bare hand, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you, that when ever you are gone from me, that you will croſſe the way with all the ſpeed you can make. When he was gone a good way from her, the Lady ſpoke aloud to thoſe that waited on her, Do you think that you are good Servants, and diligent to guard me, ſince he himſelf (concerning whom you were bid to have ſuch a care) hath Diſcourſed with me all this day, and you have permitted him ſo to do? you do well deſerve that your good Maſter, who doth repoſe ſo much truſt in you, ſhould reward you with blows of a Cane on your ſhoulders, inſtead of the wages you expect. When the Gentleman who had the charge of her heard this, he was ſo impatient that he could make no anſwer, but immediately did put
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119929:90"/>ſpurs to his horſe, calling to two others that were in the Company to follow him; they made ſo great a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, that they had almoſt overtaken the Frier, who looking back, and ſeeing them to make up unto him, did ride away as faſt as ever his horſe could carry him, they in a full gallop purſued him; and becauſe they were better mounted, the poor Frier was taken, but not knowing wherefore, he did cry them mercy, and putting off his hood, he ſhewed his bare and ſhaven crown, and began humbly to beſeech them: Whereupon they knew that he was not the Man they looked for, and that the young Lady did but laugh at them; which ſhe yet did more at their return, ſaying, That ſuch people were fit to be a guard to ſuch Women, who ſuffer them to ſpeak they know not to whom, and then adding faith to their words, they go to act a miſchief on the ſervants of God; and after all theſe mocks ſhe came to the place where her Husband appointed ſhe ſhould have her reſidence, where her two Siſter-in-laws, and the Husband of one of them, did keep her in great ſubjection; And during that time, her Husband un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that his Ring was engaged for fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns, for which he was ſorry. But to ſave the Reputation of his wife, and to recover the Ring, he ſent her word, that ſhe ſhould call for it back of the Merchant, and that he would pay the fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns. She who had no care of the Ring, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her Friend had the money that was lent upon it, did write unto him, That her Husband was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with her to Redeem the Ring; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might not think that ſhe did it to diminiſh the good will that was betwixt them, ſhe ſent him a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond which her Guardian gave her at her departure from her, which ſhe loved better than the Ring ſhe had of her Husband. The Gentleman that was her friend did willingly ſend her back the Merchants Obligation, and was well content with the 1500 Crowns, &amp; to have received a Diamond, the witnes of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:119929:91"/>the Continuation of the affection of the young Lady to him. Howſoever, as long as her Husband lived, he could never arrive to the opportunity to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, but only by Letters; And after the Death of her Husband, thinking that ſhe would continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, according to her promiſe, he uſed all his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and endeavours to procure her in Marriage, but he found that in his long abſence ſhe had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her ſelf with a Companion that was better belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved than himſelf; for which he was poſſeſſed with ſuch a ſotrow and indignation of ſpirit, that flying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Ladies, he ſought altogether after great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and places of as much danger as honour, where he was as well beloved as it was poſſible for a young Man to be, and ſo he finiſhed his days.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See here, my Ladies, that without ſparing our own Sex, I have given an Example unto Husbands, to ſhow them that women of a great ſpirit, are ſooner overcome with anger and vengeance, than with Love and Courtſhip; and although this Lady knew a long time to reſiſt, yet at the laſt ſhe was vanquiſhed by deſpite, which a virtuous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought not be; or in whatſoever ſort it be, ſhe ought not to find an Excuſe to do evill: And by how much the more great the occaſions of the offence are given, by ſo much the more virtuous ought they to demonſtrate themſelves, by reſiſting and overcomming Evil with Good, and not by recompencing Evil with Evil; And oftentimes the Evil which one thinks to render to another, doth fall upon his own head. Thrice happy are they in whom the Graces of God do demonſtrate themſelves, by the Examples of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, Sweetneſs, Patience, and Longammity.</hi> Hircan <hi>ſaid unto her, It ſeems to me,</hi> Longaren, <hi>that the Lady who was the ſubject of your Diſcourſe, was led on more by deſpite, than Love; for if ſhe had loved the Gentleman as well as ſhe made an apparence, ſhe had not abandoned him for another, and by the whole tenour of your diſcourſe ſhe ſhewed her ſelf to be spitefull, revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, obſtinate, and inconſtant. You ſpeak at random (ſaid</hi> Emarſuite <hi>to</hi> Hircan) <hi>but you know not what a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:119929:91"/>heart-braking it is to love, and not to be beloved again.

               <p>IN the time of the grand Maſter <hi>de Chaumont,</hi> there was in the City of <hi>Milan</hi> a Lady who was eſteemed one of the moſt virtuous women that lived in that age. She had been married to an <hi>Italian</hi> Count, whoſe Relict ſhe was, and lived in the ſame houſe with her
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:119929:92"/>Brother-in-laws. She could never indure to hear any talk of a ſecond Husband, and did deport her ſelf ſo diſcreetly, and devoutly, that there was not either a <hi>Frenchman</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> in the whole Dutchie of <hi>Milan,</hi> who did not highly eſteem her. One day when her Brother-in-laws, and others of her Kinred made a great Feaſt to the grand Maſter <hi>De Chaumont,</hi> this widdow was conſtrained to be preſent at it, being never before at ſuch a meeting ſince her Husbands Death, or in any other publike place. When the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> beheld her, they did highly extol her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and flowing carriage, and above all one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe Name I will conceal, but it ſhall ſuffice, that in all <hi>Italy</hi> there was not a <hi>Frenchman</hi> more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be beloved than himſelf: For he was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed with all the beauties and the graces that are requiſite to a gallant Gentleman. And although he beheld this Lady Dowager in her black attires, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the youth, and in a corner amongſt the old Ladies, yet he whom neither man nor woman could ever ſubdue unto a Capacity of Diſtruſt, did begin with confidence to court her, and to take off her mask, and forſaking the Dancing did altogether addict himſelf to the Company of this Lady; And all the evening he ſtirred not from her, but diſcourſed with her, and the old Ladies in her Company, amongſt whom he found more delight than amongſt all the brave and gallant Ladies of the Court; Inſomuch that when they were all to depart, he had not the lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he thought, to hold diſcourſe with any of the reſt. And although he talked with her of common ſubjects fit for ſuch a publick Company, yet ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved well enough that he had a great deſire to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, and reſolved with her ſelf to keep from him as much as poſſibly ſhe could, inſomuch that he could never ſee her afterwards, neither at any Feaſts or Publick aſſembly, which made him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the more after her, and he found that ſhe often frequented the Churches and religious places, where
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:119929:92"/>he kept ſo good a watch, that ſhe could not go ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, but he would be there before her, and would be ſure to ſtay in the Church as long as poſſibly he could ſee her, and all the time he was there he would contemplate on her beauties with ſo devout an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that ſhe could not be ignorant of the love which he did bear unto her. To avoid which, ſhe for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time reſolved with her ſelf to counterfeit her ſelf ſick, and to hear Maſſe in her own Houſe; at which the Gentleman was ſo ſorry, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be more, for he had no other means to ſee her, but only in the Church: She believing that in her abſence he had diſcontinued his Cuſtom to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the religious places, did return to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es as before, which love preſently declared to the Gentleman, who betook himſelf again to his former Devotions; and becauſe ſhe ſhould make no more obſtructions in the progreſſe of his love, and for fear that he ſhould not have that happy leiſure again to make known his affections to her, (one morning, when ſhe thought ſhe was ſafe enough in a little Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel where ſhe heard Maſſe) he came to the end of the Altar, and ſeeing but two or three more neer unto her, as the Prieſt ſhew'd them <hi>Corpus Domini,</hi> he turned to her, and ſaid, Madam, Let that be my Damnation whom the Prieſt now holds in his hands, if you are not the only cauſe of my Death. For although you have taken from me all the means of ſpeaking to you, yet you cannot be ignorant of my Love, for the Truth doth ſufficiently declare it to you by my languiſhing eyes, and by my pale countenance. The Lady ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not to underſtand him, made anſwer, That God ought not in that manner to be invoked in vain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Poets do affirm, that at Lovers perjuries the Gods do laugh, and that women who love their honour ought nor to be credulous or compaſſionate; And ſpeaking thoſe words, ſhe did ariſe, and return'd to her Lodging. If the Gentleman were not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the heart with this anſwer, thoſe who by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:119929:93"/>have found the like, are able to affirm. But he who wanted not a good heart, had rather go away with that unpromiſing anſwer, than to have failed in declaring his good will unto her, which he continued for the ſpace of two or three years, and courted her by Letters and preſents, without loſing time or tide; But during all that time, he could obtain no other anſwer, but that ſhe did fly from him, as the Lamb did from the Wolf; yet ſomething was inſinuated, that it was not ſo much for any hatred ſhe did bear him, but for the fear of her honour, and reputation, which he perceived ſo well, that more vigorouſly than ever before he purſued his affair. And after many pains, refuſals, torments, and deſpairs, the Lady obſerving the force and continuance of his love, did take pity on him, and did grant him that which he had ſo much deſired, and ſo long attended. And when they had agreed upon the means, the <hi>French</hi> Gentleman failed not to adventure into the Houſe, although his life thereby was in great jeopardy, ſeeing that a great part of her Kinred did lodge in the ſame houſe with her. But ſhe who had no leſſe wit than beauty, did direct him ſo diſcreetly, that he came into her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on the hour ſhe aſſigned, where he found her ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone in a very rich Bed, and as he made haſt to put off his cloaths to go into the Bed to her, he heard a great noiſe at the door of people ſpeaking to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and of ſwords claſhing againſt the walls. The Lady with a Countenance half dead, ſaid unto him, At this minute is both your Life and my Honour in the greateſt Danger that poſſibly can be, for too well I underſtand, that my Brothers are ſeeking you out to kill you. Wherefore I intreat you to conceal your ſelf under my Bed, for when they cannot find you, I ſhall have a juſt occaſion to be angry with them, by reaſon of this alarm, which without Cauſe they have given. The Gentleman, whoſe noble heart did always ſcorn the baſe effects of Fear, replyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, And who are your Brothers, that they ſhould
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:119929:93"/>make me afraid? If the whole Generation of them were together, I am confident that they would not ſtand againſt the point, or the edge of my Sword; wherefore lie ſtill in your Bed, and let me alone to guard your Door. Immediatly he clapped his cloak about his arm, and took his Sword in his hand, and opened the Door to find thoſe Swords more neer him, which made ſo great a noiſe; The Door being ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he beheld two Chambermaids, who with two ſwords in either hand did occaſion the Alarm; they ſaid unto him, Monſieur, Pardon us, for we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Commiſſion from our Miſtreſſe to do as we have done; but you ſhall have no other hinderance or diſturbance by us: The Gentleman ſeeing they were two Maids, did wiſh all the Devils in Hell take them both, and ſhutting the Door on the faces of them, he made all the ſpeed he could to the Ladies Bed, whoſe frights had no ways diminiſhed his love, and forgetting to ask her the reaſon of that skirmiſh, he thought on nothing but to ſatisfie his deſires. And perceiving that the Day approached, he intreated her to tell him, wherefore ſhe had done him ſo ill an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by holding him ſo long in delayes, and alſo what was the meaning of the Enterpriſe of the two Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaids the laſt night.

               <head>King <hi>Francis</hi> ſhewed his Generoſity to Count <hi>William,</hi> who would have been the Author of his Death.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Dijon</hi> in the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> there came to the ſervice of King <hi>Francis,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Count called <hi>William,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to which that of <hi>Savoy</hi> is ſo neer allyed, that heretofore they were but one Family. This Gentleman being eſteemed to be as gallant, and as brave a Man, as any was in <hi>Germany,</hi> was ſo well entertained by the King, that he not only received him into his ſervice, but preferred him to a place of Honour neer unto him, and made him Gentleman of his Chumber. One day the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> Lord of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> an antient Cavalier, and a loyal ſervant of the Kings, being cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and ſuſpecting the damage of his Maſter, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes keep Spies upon his Enemies, to obſerve what they did do, and carried himſelf ſo diſcreetly, that few things were concealed from him. Amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advertiſements, it was written to him by one of his Friends, that Count <hi>William</hi> had received a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sum of Money, and a promiſe to have the Sum doubled, to procure the Kings Death, upon any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt whatſoever. The Lord of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> who was alſo Governour of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> did not fail to come in his own perſon to acquaint the King with it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it not from his Mother Madam <hi>de Louiſe</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who forgat all the Alliance ſhe had to that <hi>German</hi> Count, and beſought the King to remove him from his ſervice with what ſpeed he could. The King required them to make no more words of it, for it was impoſſible, he ſaid, that ſo honeſt a Gentleman, and of ſo fair a Fame, ſhould enterpriſe ſo foul a ſin. At the end of a few Moneths there arrived another ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, in confirmation of the former; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Governour, inflamed with the zeal which he did bear to his Maſters ſafety, demanded leave of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119929:95"/>him either to put him away, or to give him order to apprehend him; but the King expreſly charged him to make not the leaſt appearance of any diſcontent, and aſſured him, that he intended to find out the truth himſelf ſome other way. One day when he repaired to the Chace, he took with him the beſt Sword that was in all his Armory, and deſired Count <hi>William</hi> to go along with him, and to be the foremoſt and the next Man unto him. The King having ſome houres hunted the Buck, did obſerve, that all his people were far behind him, but Count <hi>William</hi> only; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he turned out of the Road-way, and riding with Count <hi>William</hi> into the bottom of the Forreſt, he drew his Sword, and asked Count <hi>William</hi> If it were not a good one. The Count taking it into his hand, told him, That he never ſaw a better. You have reaſon ſo to ſay, ſaid the King, and me-thinks if a Gentleman had reſolved to kill me, and knew the Goodneſs of my heart, and the force of my hand ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with this ſword, he ſhould think to aſſault me twice, before he undertook it once, howſoever I ſhall account him but a Coward, if he &amp; I being alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any witneſſe at all, he ſhall not dare to execute what he hath not been aſhamed to undertake. Count <hi>William</hi> with an amazed countenance did anſwer him, Sir, The wickedneſſe of the Enterpriſe ſhould be great enough, and the folly to put it in Execution would be greater. The King laughing, did put his Sword into the ſcabbard again, and underſtanding by the noiſe of the Hounds, and the Hollas of the Hunters, that the Game was neer him, did put ſpurs to his Horſe, and galloped up towards them as faſt as ever he could. Being amongſt them, he ſpake not the leaſt word to any of that affair, and aſſured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that Count <hi>William,</hi> although he was as able in height and Courage, and as well diſpoſed in his limbs, as any man in his Kingdom, yet he was not the Man that would adventure on ſo bold an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. But Count <hi>William</hi> being vexed to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:119929:96"/>came one morning very early to <hi>Robertet,</hi> Socre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Treaſury, and told him, That he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of the benefits and promiſes that the King had either beſtowed or made unto him, to continue with him, which were not of a competency to maintain him above one half of the year; and if the King plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to double his allowance, he muſt be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to retire into his own Countrey: he therefore beſought <hi>Robertet,</hi> that as ſoon as poſſibly he could he might underſtand the pleaſure of the King, who told him, that he could advance his Exhibitions no higher, and if he would he might depart immediatly; which Commiſſion he very willingly accepted; for he had ſeen the advertiſements of the Governour of <hi>Burgundy.</hi> And as ſoon as the King was awake, there being preſent the Governour of <hi>Tremoville,</hi> and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Boninet,</hi> (who were both altogether ignorant what the King had done in the Forreſt) he ſaid unto them, You have a deſire to drive away Count <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> and Count <hi>William</hi> hath a deſire to go away of himſelf; Wherefore you may tell him, That if he will not be contented with the Penſion which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he hath accepted in my ſervice, and which divers Gentlemen of Honourable Families do think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves happy to receive, it is reaſon that he ſhould ſeek out better Fortunes in ſome other place: And as for my ſelf, I will no ways hinder him, but ſhall be very glad to hear that he hath found a Fortune, ſuch as with content he may live upon, and ſuitable to his merits. <hi>Robertet</hi> was as diligent to carry this anſwer to the Count, as he was willing to carry his Requeſt unto the King. The Count replyed, That with the Kings leave he was then reſolved to be gone; And, as one whom Fear conſtrained to depart, he knew not how to carry it four and twenty hours: But as the King was ſet at the Table at dinner, he took his leave of him, pretending a great grief that his Neceſſities were ſuch, that they inforced him to loſe his preſence. He alſo addreſſed himſelf to the Mother of the King,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119929:96"/>to take his leave of her, who gave him leave to depart as willingly as ſhe received him joyfully, being both a Kinſman and a Friend. And in this diſcontent he departed to his Countrey. The King obſerving his Mother and his Servants in Extraordinary to be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at his ſudden departure, did inform them of the Alarm which he had given him, ſaying, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he believed he was innocent of that which was laid to his charge, yet he found that he was poſſeſſed with a great fear, which brought forth a deſire to be gone from that Maſter whoſe complexion he as yet not underſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For my own part, Ladies, I can find no other thing that could move the heart of the King to hazard himſelf alone againſt ſo brave a Man at Arms, and leaving all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and the place and Majeſty due unto a King, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Combat of his Inferiour, but only that he would render himſelf equal to that admirable Prince who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Enemy, and to content himſelf, did give him the Experience of the Nobleneſſe and Courage of his own heart. And without contradiction</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>he had reaſon for it; for the praiſes of all the Men in the world cannot ſo much ſatisfie a good heart, as the knowledge and the experience that it hath of the Virtues wherewith God hath endued it.

And although he was ſo knowing, that, being but eighteen years of age, he ſeemed to be a Document, and an Example unto others, yet Love made him to ſing after his Leſſon; And to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood and received, Love hid himſelf under the Damask complexion, and in the eyes of the moſt beautiful young Lady that was in all that Countrey, who for the following of a Sute ſhe had in Law, was come to that City. But before Love had aſſayed to overcome the Gentleman by the beauties of this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he had gained the heart of her, by obſerving the perfections that were in him; for in Beauty, Grace, good Senſe, and gallant Elocution, there was not

You (who do apprehend the ready and uncontrolled way which this Fire doth make, when it hath taken hold of one of the corners of the heart, and of the Fancy) will eaſily judge, that in two ſo perfect Subjects Love made no long delay, but had them both at his Commandement, and filled them both with ſo clear a light, that all their thoughts, will, and diſcourſe, were but the flames of that Love, which (with their youth, which begot a fear in them) did make him to purchaſe and compleat his Affairs with the greateſt ſweetneſſe that poſſibly could be. But ſhe who at firſt was overcome by Love, needed no force. Nevertheleſſe, by reaſon of the ſhame which accompanieth young Ladies, to the uttermoſt of her power ſhe did ſtand upon her guard, and did forbear to ſhew her good will, untill that at the laſt, the Fortreſſe of her heart, which is the Seat of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, was ſo ruined, that the poor Lady did agree to that, to which ſhe could not be diſagreeing: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to make trial of the patience, aſſurance, and love of her Servant, ſhe did grant him that which he demanded, but upon too hard conditions, aſſuring him, That if he ſhould obſerve them, ſhe would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes love him moſt intirely, and if he failed in the performance, he ſhould never enjoy her whileſt he lived. The Condition was, That ſhe was content to Diſcourſe with him in Bed together, having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on him but the Linen next unto their Bodies; but ſo, that he muſt not demand any thing at all of her, but only a Complement, and a Kiſſe. He, who thought there was no Joy that was worthy to be compared to this, did eaſily accord unto it.</p>
               <p>The Evening being come, the promiſe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, where for all the good entertainment ſhe gave him, and his and her ſtriving deſires, he would not violat his oath; And although he conceived that his torment was not leſſe than that of Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet his love was ſo great, and his hope ſo ſtrong
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:119929:98"/>(being ſure of the perpetual continuance of her love which with ſo long reluctation he had purchaſed) that his patience overcame, and in the morning he did riſe from her without doing her the leaſt diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. The young Lady (as I believe) being more aſtoniſhed than contented with it, did immediately begin to ſuſpect with her ſelf, that his love was not ſo great as ſhe conceived, or that he found not in her ſo much delight as at firſt he propounded to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſhe had not the leaſt thought of the greatneſſe of his honeſty, nor of his patience, or fidelity, and his care to keep his oath: Wherfore ſhe reſolved with herſelf to make one proof more of his Love, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to Court a Gentlewoman in her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that was younger than her ſelf, and almoſt as handſom, that thoſe who obſerved him ſo often to come unto her lodgings, might conceive that his love was to her Companion, and not unto herſelf. The young Lord, who aſſured himſelf to be beloved by her, as long as he was a faithfull Servant to her, did obey her command, and inforced himſelf by the love he did vow to her, to make love to this young Gentlewoman, who ſeeing him ſo lovely, and ſo well ſpoken, did believe his pretence as it had been a truth, and loved him, as if altogether ſhe had been beloved by him. When the Miſtreſſe perceived that it did go on ſo forward, and that nevertheleſſe, the young Lord did not ceaſe to put her in mind of her promiſe, ſhe concluded with him, that he ſhould come unto her one hour after Midnight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe had ſuch experience of the greatneſſe of his love and obedience to her, it was reaſon, ſhe ſaid, that he ſhould be recompenced for his patience. We make no doubt of the great Joy which this affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Servant received to hear this promiſe, who fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not to come at the time appointed. But the Lady to make a further trial of the force of his love, did ſpeak unto her young Companion, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the love very well which ſuch a young Lord
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119929:98"/>doth bear unto you, and I believe your paſſion is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual unto his. I have ſuch a tender regard unto you both, that I am reſolved to give place unto you, and leaſure to diſcourſe together at your own caſe as long as you will. The young Gentlewoman was tranſported with ſo great a Joy that ſhe could not diſſemble her affections to her, but aſſured her, that ſhe would not fail to be obedient to her counſels; Whereupon ſhe did put off her cloaths, and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone did go into a fair bed in one of the next cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; The Lady left the door open, and cauſed a great wax candle to be lighted in it, that the beauty of this young Gentlewoman might be the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; And counterfeiting to go to her own lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, ſhe did hide herſelf behind the hangings ſo cloſely that ſhe could not be perceived. Her poor Servant thinking to find her (accordingly as ſhe had promiſed him) did not fail to come into the chamber on the appointed hour as ſoftly as poſſibly he could, and after he had ſhut the door, and put off his Gown &amp; his Breeches, he leapt into the bed, where he thought to have found her whom he ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, &amp; no ſooner did he ſtretch forth his arms to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her, whom he conceived to be his Lady, but the poor young Gentlewoman who thought ſhe had him ſure enough, had her own arms about his neck, and did deliver to him ſuch affectionate words, and with ſo ſweet a countenance, that there is no Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo holy but would have forgot his Pater-noſters. But when he diſcoverd who ſhe was, both by his eye and by his ear; Love, who with ſo great a ſpeed brought him to bed, made him to riſe from it with a greater; And with an indignation as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lady as the young Gentlewoman, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Lady (who betrayed herſelf by her laughter) and ſaid unto her, The folly as much of your ſelf as of the Damſel, whom with ſo much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty you have put in yonder bed, ſhall make me no other than I am; but doe your endeavour to be a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119929:99"/>good woman, for by no occaſion of mine you ſhall loſe your good Name. And ſpeaking thoſe words, being as full of Deſpite as it was impoſſible to be more, he departed out of the chamber, and for a long time came not into any place where this Lady was. Nevertheleſſe Love, who is never without hope, did aſſure her that the more firm his love was, and known to be more great by ſo long experience, the more happy and gratefull would the fruition prove. And having conſidered on the paſſages of the young Lord her ſervant, and her companion, ſhe was ſo well contented and amazed to perceive the greatneſſe and ſtrength of his love, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med long unto her until ſhe found ſome occaſion to ſeek him out to crave pardon of him for the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate ſorrows which ſhe had brought upon him, and as ſoon as ever ſhe had the much deſired happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſpeak unto him, ſhe not failed to give him ſo many couteous and good aſſurances, that he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did paſſe over his former torments, but judged them moſt happy, ſince they were all turned into the glory and perfection of his love, of which ever afterwards he had the fruition without any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, or wearineſſe, even to the height of his deſires.</p>

                  <hi>Ladies, I beſeech you, find me out one woman ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, ſo patient, and ſo loyal in love as this man hath been. Thoſe who have made tryal of them by ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do find them to be ſuch whom we find painted at St.</hi> Anthonies, <hi>very little and rare, but of a great price: and to ſpeak the truth, few men themſelves are of this mans temper; for he who can be chaſt with the beauty and the love of women, and patient at the time and the leiſures of women, is virtuous enough to overcome all the Devils in Hell. It is pity</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla) <hi>that he did not addreſse himſelf unto a Gentlewe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as virtuous as himſelf, for it would have been the moſt honeſt and moſt abſolute love that had been ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. But tell me I pray</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>which task
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:119929:99"/>of his two do you conceive moſt difficult? It ſeems to me the laſt,</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>for Deſpite above all is the moſt violent temptation.</hi> Longaren <hi>was of opinion that the firſt was the greateſt; for it was neceſſary, ſhe ſaid, to fulfill his promiſe, that he ſhould overcome both Love and himſelf. You ſpeak at random, ſaid</hi> Simon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tault, <hi>but we who know well enough what things are, ought to ſpeak what we know: And for my ſelf, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his firſt command I think he was a Fool, and in the ſecond a Sot: For I believe, that in performing his promiſe to his Lady, ſhe had as much or more trouble than himſelf. She had not cauſed him to take that Oath, but only becauſe ſhe counterfeited her ſelf to be a far better woman than ſhe was; for ſhe knew it was ſure enough, That a ſtrong Love cannot be bound, either by Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or by Oath, or by any thing that is in the world. But ſhe did diſſemble her vice to be ſo virtuous, that it could not be obtained but by Heroick Virtues. And in the ſecond place he ſhewed himſelf a Sot, to forſake her who loved him, and was more worthy than ſhe to whom he had made his Oath, and had ſo good an Excuſe, by reaſon of the Deſpite which at that time poſſeſſed him.</hi> Dagoucin <hi>reproved him, ſaying, that he was of a contrary opinion; And that at the firſt time he ſhewed himſelf to be firm, patient, and true; and at the ſecond, loyal, and entire in his love: And what know we, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>if he were not one of thoſe who are treated of, in the Chapter</hi> De Frigidis &amp; Maleficiatis? <hi>But if</hi> Hircan <hi>would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh his praiſes, he ought to account us, what a gentle Companion he was, after that he had enjoyed that which be deſired: And for the preſent, how can we judge, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were a Virtue, or a Weakneſſe, that made him ſo tame? You may be ſure, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that if I had been informed of it, I would have concealed it no more than the reſt; but if you did look upon his perſon, or knew his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, you would ſay after me, that he was guided ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the force of Love, than any weakneſſe or frigidity. If he were ſuch a one then (as you ſpeak him) ſaid</hi> Simon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tault, <hi>he ſhould have broken his Oath, and if ſhe had
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:119929:100"/>been angry for ſo little, ſhe might have quickly been appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But it may be</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>that at that time ſhe was not willing. What and if ſhe were not, ſaid</hi> Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredant, <hi>had ſhe not been eaſie to have been forced, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already given unto him the poſſeſſion of the Camp. Saint</hi> Mary (<hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>How wide you draw? Is that the way to obtain the favour of a Lady whom you eſteem wiſe and honeſt. It ſeems to me, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>that we cannot do more honour to a woman, of whom we deſire ſuch a favour, than to take it by force: for the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Baggage in the world doth deſire to be a long time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated; and ſome there are who muſt be preſented with great gifts, before they can be obtained; and others are ſo fooliſh, who neither by preſents nor by Complements can be obtained, to whom we muſt make uſe of other means. And when we have to do with one ſo wiſe, that ſhe will not be deceived, and ſo good, that ſhe will not be gained either by great gifts, or good words, is it not reaſon to uſe all the means that poſſibly we can to obtain the Victory? And when at any time you hear it spoken, that a Man hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a woman by force, believe it, that the Woman had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of all hope of any other means; and think not the worſe of the Man, who hath put his life in jeopardy to give place unto his Love.</hi> Guebron <hi>began to laugh, and ſaid, I have ſeen in my days places beſieged, and taken by force, becauſe it was not poſſible to bring thoſe unto a Parley who did keep them, either by money, or by threatnings, for they ſay, That a Parlying Town is half gained. I believe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>that all the Loves of the World are grounded upon theſe Follies; howſoever there are ſome to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who have loved, and honourably continued in their love, without being ſubject to any ſuch looſe Intention. If you know of any ſuch, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>I give you my voice, and the Speakers place; I know it to be true,</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>and therefore I will willingly give you an account thereof.</hi>

               <head>Of two Lovers, who deſpairing to be married the one unto the other, did betake themſelves to two places of Religion, the one to a Covent of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and the other to S. <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Clare.</hi>

               <p>IN the time of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantua</hi> who was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed to the Siſter of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> there lived in the Houſe of the Dutcheſſe a Damſel named <hi>Paulina,</hi> who was ſo well beloved by a Gentleman who was a Servant to the Marqueſſe, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his affection was admired by all the world; And becauſe he was but poor, and a gentile Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, his Maſter, in the love he did bear unto him, did adviſe him to look out ſome wife that was rich, and able to maintain him; but he thought that all the Treaſure in the world was in <hi>Paulina,</hi> which, in marrying her, he ſhould poſſeſſe. The Marchioneſſe alſo deſiring, That <hi>Paulina</hi> might have a richer Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or none, did diſtaſt the proceedings of the Marriage as much as poſſibly might be, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times would not ſuffer them to hold any Diſcourſe with one another, and did demonſtrate to them, that if the ſaid Marriage ſhould go on, they would be two of the pooreſt, &amp; moſt miſerable creatures in all <hi>Italy.</hi> But this reaſon could not enter into the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Gentleman. <hi>Paulina</hi> (as well as ſhe could) did for her part diſſemble her love ſhe did bear unto the Gentleman, howſoever her heart was entire unto him. This love continued a long time, and was attended with a hope, that at laſt they ſhould meet with ſome Fortunes that were anſwerable to their deſires. Some few years afterwards this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in a great Battel was taken priſoner with a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who was as deep in love with a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119929:101"/>in <hi>France,</hi> as he was with one in <hi>Italy.</hi> And when they found themſelves Companions of one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, they began more familiarly to diſcover the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their hearts the one unto the other. The <hi>Frenchman</hi> confeſſed that his heart was a priſoner as well as his, but would not name him the perſon or the place. But being both in the ſervice of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> the <hi>Frenchman</hi> knew well enough that his companion loved <hi>Paulina,</hi> and for the love which he did bear to his profit and advantage he did adviſe him to remove his affections from her, which the <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman did ſwear was not in his own power, and that if the Marqueſſe of <hi>Mantua,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his impriſonment, and the good ſervice he had done for him, would ſtill refuſe to let him have his Sweet-heart, he would turn Grey Friar, and never ſerve any other Maſter but God; which the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> could not believe, for he ſaw not in him any ſign of religion at all, but only the devotion he had unto <hi>Paulina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the end of three months the <hi>French</hi> Gentleman was delivered from priſon, and prevailed ſo much by his diligence, that not long afterwards he procured the liberty of his Companion, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his utmoſt endeavour both with the Marqueſſe and Marchioneſſe, that they would give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Marriage with <hi>Paulina;</hi> but he could not perſwade them to it, for they repreſented to him the poverty in which they ſhould both live, and that on both ſides their Parents and Kinred were much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at it, and they forbade him to ſpeak unto them any more of it, to the end that their love at laſt might paſſe away by abſence and impoſſibility. When the <hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman perceived that he was conſtrained to obey the command of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe,</hi> he demanded leave of the Marchio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to take his leave of <hi>Paulina,</hi> ſeeing he ſhould never ſpeak unto her again, which was agreed unto, and immediately in theſe words
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119929:101"/>he ſpake unto her. Since it is ſo <hi>Paulina,</hi> that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth are againſt us, not only to hinder us in our Marriage, but (which is worſe) to take from us for ever the ſight of one another, and that upon command I muſt not ſpeak any more to you, nor you to me; This command is rigorous indeed; our Maſter and Miſtreſſe may well boaſt that with one word they have wounded two hearts whoſe bodies needs muſt languiſh, and they have proved that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love nor pity did ever enter into their breaſts. I do know that their aim is to marry us richly to ſome others, but they are ignorant that the trueſt riches do conſiſt in a contented mind, and hereby they have done me ſo great an injury that it is impoſſible I ſhould ever do them ſervice again. I do believe, that if I had never ſpoken to them of this marriage, they had not been ſo ſcrupulous as not to have ſuffered us to diſcourſe together, and I do aſſure you that I had rather dye than change my affection into worſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loved you with ſo honeſt and ſo virtuous a love, and purchaſed that of you which during my life I ought to defend; And becauſe that in ſeeing you I cannot endure that hard patience as not to ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and becauſe in not ſeeing you, my heart (which never can be empty) will be filled with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair which will make my end unfortunate, I am reſolved, and have a long time been, to put my ſelf in a religious houſe, not, but that I know very well that in all Eſtates a man may be ſaved, but to have the more leiſure to contemplate the divine bounty, which I do hope will have pity on the faults of my youth, and will work a change in my heart to love ſpiritual things as well as temporal; and if God ſhall give me the grace to arrive to the knowledge of the Religion, my devotions ſhall inceſſantly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to pray unto God for you, beſeeching you by that love ſo firm and loyal which hath been betwixt us two, to remember me in your prayers, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech our Lord to give me as much patience in not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:119929:102"/>ſeeing you, as he hath given me content in ſeeing you. And becauſe I hoped all my life to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed you in marriage, which honour and conſcience do permit, I am contented that I had that hope, although I muſt now loſe it; and becauſe I cannot receive the entertainment from you which belongs unto a Husband, yet at the leaſt, in bidding farewell unto you, vouchſafe me the entertainment of a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and give me leave to kiſſe you. Poor <hi>Paulina</hi> who had been always too ſevere unto him, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the extremity of his grief, and the honeſty of his requeſt, that in ſo great a deſpair he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with a thing ſo reaſonable, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any anſwer to him, did throw her arms about his neck, and weeped with ſo much bitterneſſe and fainting of heart, that her words, her underſtanding, and her force failed her, and ſhe ſwouned away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his arms, and the pity thereof accompanied with his love and ſorrow, did cauſe him to do the like, Inſomuch that one of her companions ſeeing her to fall down on the one ſide, and him on the other, did call out for help, and by force of remedies did revive them. <hi>Paulina</hi> who was deſired to diſſemble her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was aſhamed that ſhe had ſhewed her love to be ſo violent; Nevertheleſſe, the pity ſhe had on the poor Gentleman did ſerve her for an excuſe, &amp; being not able to endure the word that did bid her farewell for ever, ſhe did go away preſently, her teeth as ſhut up as her heart, &amp; entring into her chamber as a dead body without a Soul, ſhe fell down upon her bed, and paſſed away that night in ſuch complaints and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, that her ſervants believed ſhe at once had loſt her parents, and all her kinred, and friends, and whatſoever was of comfort to her upon Earth. In the morning ſhe in her prayers recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to our Saviour the Gentleman that was her friend, who after he had diſtributed amongſt his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the poor fortunes he was maſter of, and taken with him a certain ſum of ſilver, he did forbid any of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119929:102"/>his people to follow him, and repaired all alone to a Religious houſe to demand the habit, being reſolved with himſelf never to put on any other. The War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Covent, who had ſeen him before, did think at firſt that it was but a Fable or Mockery; for in all the Countrey there was not a Gentleman that ſhewed leſſe reſpect unto a Grey Frier, than himſelf; for he had in him all the knowing virtues and graces that could belong unto a Gentleman. But after he had underſtood his words, and obſerved his tears falling like Rivers from his eyes, being not ignorant from whence the ſource proceeded, he courteouſly did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him; and not long afterwards ſeeing his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, he gave him the habit of a Frier, which he did put on with great Content.</p>
               <p>The Marqueſſe and the Marchioneſſe being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of it, did find it ſo ſtrange, that not without great difficulty they could believe it. <hi>Paulina,</hi> to ſhew her ſelf not ſubject unto the tyranny of Love, did diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it as well as poſſibly ſhe could; inſomuch, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one told her, That ſhe quickly had forgot the great affection of her loyal Servant: She continued thus five or ſix moneths without making any other Remonſtrance; during which time, there was ſhewed unto her a Song by one of the Religious Men, which her Servant had compoſed preſently after he had put on his religious habit, the Song is in <hi>Italian,</hi> and common enough; Which when ſhe had peruſed, and read it all over, going into the Chapel by her ſelf, ſhe wept ſo abundantly, that ſhe dewed all the paper with her tears; and were it not for a fear ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that ſhe ſhould ſhew her ſelf more affectionate than became her, ſhe had immediatly gone into ſome Hermitage, with a reſolution never to ſee again any creature in the world: but the Diſcretion which ſhe had, did conſtrain her for a ſhort time to diſſemble it. And although ſhe had taken a reſolution altogether to renounce the world, ſhe pretended the contrary, and kept her countenance ſo reſerved, that being in
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:119929:103"/>Company there appeared nothing of that Melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to which ſhe had abandoned her ſelf. She carried this Reſolution covered in her heart five or ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, ſhewing her ſelf more joyful than ſhe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be; But one day waiting upon her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe to hear the High Maſſe, after that the Prieſt was come out of the Veſtry to go unto the great Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, her poor Servant, who was yet in the year of his Probationerſhip, did ſerve at the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying two little bottles covered with white Silk in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, was the firſt that preſented himſelf, having his eyes fixed on the Ground. When <hi>Paulina</hi> ſaw him in that habiliment, in which his Gracefulneſſe and Beauty was rather increaſed, than diminiſhed, ſhe was ſo troubled and aſtoniſhed, that to cover the bluſhes which took poſſeſſion of her cheeks, ſhe began to cough; Her poor Servant, who did better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ſound, than the Bel of the Monaſtery, durſt not turn aſide his head, but paſſing along by her, he could not govern his eyes from beholding that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to which ſo long they had been accuſtomed, and looking on <hi>Paulina,</hi> he was ſo inflamed anew with the fire which he thought had been almoſt extinguiſhed, that beyond his ability endeavouring to conceal it, he fell down all along before her. And the fear which he had that the Cauſe of his Misfortune ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he made an Excuſe, that the Pavement of the Church, which was broken juſt in that place, was the occaſion of his fall. When <hi>Paulina</hi> underſtood that the change of his habit had not changed his heart, and that it was ſo long ſince he took that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon him, that every one thought ſhe had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten him, ſhe reſolved with her ſelf to put her Deſign in Execution, which was, to render their loves alike, in habit, form, and in condition of life, as it was when they lived in one houſe, under one Maſter and Miſtreſſe; And becauſe that fourteen Months before, ſhe had given order for all things that were neceſſary for her to enter into a Religious houſe, ſhe one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119929:103"/>demanded leave of the Marchioneſſe to goe to hear Maſſe at the Covent of St. <hi>Clare,</hi> which ſhe gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (being ignorant wherefore ſhe did ask it) and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the Grey Friers, ſhe intreated the Warden of the Covent to give her leave to ſee one of the Friers, whom ſhe called her Kinſman. When ſhe ſaw him in the Chapel by himſelf, ſhe ſaid unto him, If my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had permitted me to put my ſelf into a Religious Houſe, as ſoon as you did, I would not have attended untill this time, but having by my patience broken through the opinions of thoſe, who are more apt to judge Evil, than Good, I have determined with my ſelf to take upon me the ſame Condition, Robe, and Life, which I ſee you have done, without inquiring what it is: for if you find any Good, I ſhall have my part therein; and if you find any thing that is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, I will not be exempt from it; for by what way you go into Paradiſe, in the ſame I will follow you; being aſſured, that he who is the true, perfect, and the moſt worthy to be called LOVE, hath drawn us to his ſervice, by a chaſt, and virtuous love, which by his holy Spirit he will convert to our advantage, beſeeching him, That my ſelf, as well as you, may forget the Body that periſheth, and the tincture of the old <hi>Adam,</hi> to receive and put on him who is our Spouſe, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Her religious Servant, the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was ſo well contented, and ſo glad to hear her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſolution, that with weeping tears of Joy, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified her in her opinion as much as poſſibly he could, ſaying, Since he could have nothing of her in this world but words only, and was hardly permitted to have thoſe alſo, that he thought himſelf very happy to have now the means daily to ſee her, and that ſhe was of the ſame mind with him, that neither the one, nor the other, did care which of them were the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt, living in one eſtate of Love, of one heart, and of one ſpirit, being perſwaded and conducted by the bounty of God, whom he beſought to keep them both in his hand, where none could take them from him;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119929:104"/>And ſpeaking thoſe words, and weeping with tears of love and joy, he kiſſed her hands, and ſhe ſtooped her down unto his hand, and in true charity did give it the holy kiſſe of Dilection.</p>
               <p>And thus in a great content <hi>Paulina</hi> departed, and entred into the Covent, where ſhe was received, and veiled. Which afterwards ſhe ſent word of to Madam the Marchioneſſe who hardly could be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: Wherefore the next morning ſhe repaired to the Monaſtery to ſee her, and to diſſwade her from her reſolution, and if words would not prevail to add force unto her words; but <hi>Paulina</hi> did aſſure her, that if ſhe had the power to take from her a Husband of fleſh (a man whom ſhe loved beſt in this world) ſhe ought to content her ſelf, without attempting to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce her from him who is immortal and inviſible, for he was not in her power, nor under any power in the world. The Marchioneſſe obſerving her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did kiſſe her, and full of ſorrow did take her leave of her. After that time <hi>Paulina</hi> and her ſervant did live ſo holily, and ſo devoutly in their places of obſervance, that we ought not to doubt, but that he, the end of whoſe Law is charity, did in the end of their lives ſay unto them as unto <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that their ſins were all pardoned becauſe they had loved much, and that in peace he brought them to a place where their recompence doth ſurpaſſe all the merits of men, and their good deeds are crown'd with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible reward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, you cannot be ignorant, that never any man did ſhew a greater love, or which ſo perfectly was returned to him by her whom he loved that I could wiſh that all thoſe in their condition of love were as well recompenced. There would be then</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>more he-Fools and ſhe-Fools than were ever yet ſeen in the world, Do you call it folly</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>to love honeſtly in our youth, and afterwards to convert all that love unto the love of God?</hi> Hircan <hi>laughing made anſwer to her, if melancholy and deſpair be virtues, I will confeſſe that</hi> Paulina <hi>and her
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119929:104"/>ſervant are moſt worthy to be praiſed. So it is</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron) <hi>that God hath many means to draw us to him, the beginnings whereof may ſeem to be unpleaſant, but their end is good. I am of opinion</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>that a man can never love God perfectly, until firſt he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly loved ſome Creature in this World. What do you call it to love perfectly</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>Do you eſteem thoſe to be perfect lovers who are in a rapſody at the ſight of their Miſtreſſe, and kneel down before them at a great diſtance, without daring to declare their affections to them?</hi> Parlament <hi>made anſwer, I call thoſe perfect lovers, who do ſeek for ſome perfection in thoſe they love, whether it be goodneſſe, beauty, or gracefulneſſe, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be that is always tending unto virtue, and who have a heart ſo high, and honeſt, that they will rather by their deaths put an end to all corrupt deſires, than that their honours or their conſciences ſhould ſuffer. For the Soul which is not created but to return unto its ſoveraign good, hath (as long as it is even in this Body) a deſire to arrive unto it; But by reaſon that the underſtanding, by which it ſhould learn the way, is obſcure and carnal, by the ſin of our firſt Father, it cannot repreſent any thing unto it but things viſible, and which only do approach unto perfection, after which the Soul doth run, thinking to find in a viſible grace, and in moral vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the Soveraign beauty, and the Soveraign Grace, and Virtue. But when ſhe hath examined and proved them, and found that it is not that which perfectly ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, ſhe throws them by, &amp; goes on further, like an infant who in its firſt infancy loveth apples, and pears, and pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, and the faireſt things that can be preſented to the eye, and doth eſteem it great riches to heap ſmall ſtones to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; afterwards, growing into age, it loveth living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to amaſſe thoſe precious ſtones and treaſures which are neceſſary for the life of man. But when by grave experience it knoweth that in tranſitory things there is no perfection nor felicity, it deſireth to ſearch after true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and the Giver, who is the Fountain of it. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, if God ſhould not open unto us the ey of Faith,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:119929:105"/>we are in danger from being Ignorants, to become unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Philoſophers. For Faith only doth repreſent unto us, &amp;. cauſeth us to receive that Good, which a carnal man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not apprehend. See you not</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longaren) <hi>that the Ground not husbanded doth produce many herbs and trees, although they are unprofitable? which ſheweth unto us the good deſire of it, and the promiſe it doth make, that it will bring forth good fruits, when it ſhall be ſowed and weeded: So the heart of Man, which hath no other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding but by things viſible, will never arrive unto the love of God, but only by the ſowings of his holy word in the heart; for the Ground of the heart is of it ſelf barren, and cold, and almoſt loſt to all hope. And this is the Cauſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>that the greateſt part of Men are deceived, who look not but only on exterior things, and deſpiſe that which is moſt pretious, and is lodged within. If I could ſpeak</hi> Latin <hi>well, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>I would allege unto you what St.</hi> John <hi>ſaith, That</hi> He who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God, whom he hath not ſeen? <hi>for by things viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we are drawn to the love of things inviſible. Shew us the Man</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>that is ſo perfect in that love,</hi> Et laudabimus eum. <hi>There are ſome, ſaid</hi> Dagou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin, <hi>who love ſo purely, and ſo perfectly, that they had rather die, than to think one thought againſt the Honours or the Conſciences of their Miſtreſſes, and would ſo carry it, that neither their Miſtreſſes themſelves, nor any other, ſhould perceive it. They</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>are of the Nature of the</hi> Cameleon, <hi>who lives on the Air. For I am of a belief, that there is not a Man in the world who doth not deſire to declare his Love, and to be aſſured that he is beloved; and there is no Feaver of Love ſo violent, but ſuddenly will ſlack, when we come to know the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I will ſpeak it of my ſelf, I have ſeen ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles made evident. I beſeech you</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>to take my place, and to give us an account of ſome one who hath been raiſed from Death to Life, by finding his Miſtreſs to act contrary to that which he deſired. I am ſo afraid (ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>to diſpleaſe Ladies, to whom I have
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:119929:105"/>been, and ever ſhall be a Servant, that without their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Command, I durſt not give any account unto them of their Imperfections, but to ſhew my obedience I will not conceal the truth.</hi>

               <p>IN the Country of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> was a Gentleman called <hi>Signior de Ryant,</hi> who belonged to the Houſe of King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that Name, and was as honeſt and as fine a Gentleman, as could be looked on. He was a long time ſervant to a Lady that was a Widdow, whom he ſo much loved and reverenced, that for the fear he had to loſe her favour, he durſt not importune her for that which he ſo much deſired, And being handſom himſelf, and worthy to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he firmly believed that which ſhe had often ſworn unto him, which was, that ſhe loved him better than all the Gentlemen in the world, and if ſhe were put to it to do a Gentleman a courteſie, it ſhould be for him onely, as being the moſt accompliſhed Man that ſhe knew, and did entreat him to reſt himſelf conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, without tranſgreſſing that honeſt love, aſſuring him, That if ſhe knew that he pretended to any thing more, and would not be contented with reaſon, that he ſhould loſe her Love, and all.

But in the concluſion, this poor Martyr being in ſo pleaſant a Fire, that the more he burn'd, the more he would burn, did ſearch after all means to augment his Martyrdom; One morning, a fancy did poſſeſſe him to take Poſt to ſee her whom he loved better than himſelf, and eſteemed above all the Women in the world. Being arrived, he entred into the Court, and demanded where ſhe was, anſwer was made, That ſhe was but juſt come from Veſpers, and was gon into the Garden to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat her Devotions; whereupon he alighted from his Horſe, and took his courſe directly to the Garden where it was told him that ſhe was. In the way he did meet with ſome other of her ſervants, who infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, That ſhe was walking all alone in a long Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee in the Garden; wherupon he began more than ever to hope that he ſhould meet with ſome happy For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and as leiſurely as poſſibly he could he purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deſign, thinking to find her in moſt private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements. And being come to a long Arbor of plaſhed Trees, it being the moſt pleaſant, and moſt delightful place, that Art or Nature ever did contrive, he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entred in, as one who thought long till he had ſeen her whom he loved. At his firſt Entrance he found her in the Arms of the Horſe-keeper of the Houſe, as loathſom, and as naſty a fellow, as ſhe her ſelf was fair and lovely. I will not in this place undertake to declare unto you the Indignation that poffeſſed him, which was ſo great, that in one moment it had power to quench the fire which ſo long had burned. And being filled with as much deſpite, as he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with love, he ſaid unto her, Madam, Much good do't you, This day, for your diſcovered Incontinence, I am recovered, and delivered from a perpetual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, occaſioned by the rare Honeſty which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be in you. And without any other Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well he departed from her, with greater ſpeed than he came. The poor Woman made no other anſwer to him, but only covered her face with her hands
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119929:107"/>It was fit indeed that becauſe ſhe could not cover her ſhame, ſhe ſhould cover her eyes, that ſhe might not ſee him, who ſaw her now too clearly, notwithſtanding her long diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore I beſeech you, Ladies, if you have not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to love perfectly, do not diſſemble with an honeſt man, nor ſeek to displeaſe him for your own glory; for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are payed in their own Coin, and God doth favour thoſe who do love intirely. It is well</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>you have given us a good one, for the concluſion of this dayes work; And were it not, that we have ſworn to ſpeak the Truth, I could not believe that a woman of Eſtate, as ſhe was, could be ſo wicked, as to forſake an honeſt Gentleman for ſuch an ugly Varlet. Alas Madam</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>If you knew the difference betwixt a Gentleman who all his life-time hath born arms on his back, and followed the War, and a ſtrong chined, and a well-fed Groom, who never ſtirred out of doore, you would eaſily excuſe this poor widdow.</hi> Hircan (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>I cannot believe that whatſoever you can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, will make any Excuſe for her. I have often heard it ſpoken</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Simontault) <hi>that there are women, who keep Men on purpoſe to preach unto the world their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and their Chaſtity, and do give them the beſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the moſt private, that poſſibly they can, aſſuring them, that if their Honours and Conſciences might not ſuffer in it, they would comply with them in all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires; And thoſe ſilly Creatures, when they ſpeak of them in company, will ſwear, That they have put their fingers in the fire without burning them, to prove that they are Ladies of Honour and Virtue, becauſe they have had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their Goodneſs, even to their ſingers end. And thus thoſe women do hear themſelves to be commea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſuch diſhoneſt Man, and ſhew themſelves ſuch as they are to thoſe of their own Complexion, and chooſe ſuch to be their Servants, who amongſt Men of worth have not the conſidence to ſpeak, or if they do ſpeak, by reaſon of their ſordid and vile condition, they have not the credit to be believed. This is the ſame opinion, ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119929:108"/>
                  <hi>which in another ſenſe I have heard ſpoken of jealous, and ſuspitious men. But this is to pourtray a Chimaera; for although it may fall out to be true in one unfortunate woman, it ought not to be ſuspected in another.</hi>

                  <hi>Before we proceed further in this diſcourſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament) <hi>and the Gentlemen here preſent exerciſe their wits on our expence, let us riſe, and repair to the Veſpers, that we may not make the religious men to attend us ſo long as yeſterday they did. The Company were all of her opinion, and being on their way to the Chapel,</hi> Oyſilla <hi>ſaid unto them, If any of us were too blame for having not this day ſpoken the truth in thoſe hiſtories which we have delivered,</hi> Saffredant <hi>ought to demand pardon for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made ſo vile a commemoration to the diſhonour of our Sex. Upon the credit of my oath, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my account to be true enough, yet I muſt confeſs that I only heard it ſpeken, but I know ſo much of women that ſhould I speak all what I knew of them, I ſhould make as many or more ſigns of the Croſs than they do at the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a Church.</hi> Parlament <hi>replyed, He is far enough from Repentance whoſe confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth aggravat his ſin. But becauſe you have ſuch a bad opinion of women, they ought to deprive you of all entertainment and familiarity with them. He made anſwer, ſome of them, in my behalf, have ſo uſed the Counſel that you now give them, in denying me things juſt and honeſt, that if I could either speak, or do worſe unto them, I would not forbear it, to revenge my ſelf on her who doth detain me in ſo great a thraldom: And speaking thoſe words,</hi> Parlament <hi>began to ſneeze as ſhe entred with the other Ladies into the Church, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Saints bell had rung, yet there were none of the Monks to ſay ſervice, becauſe they underſtood, that this gallant Company were aſſembled in the Meadow to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of thoſe pleaſant Subjects, and being ſuch who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the vanity of their delight above their Devotions, they hid themſelves in the bottom of a ditch behind a thick hedge lying with their Bellies on the Earth, where they liſtned ſo attentively to their agreeable accounts, that they could not hear the Bell of the Monaſtery. Which did
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119929:108"/>eaſily appear, for they arrived in ſo much haſt, that their breath failed them to begin Vespers. And the ſervice being ended, they confeſſed to thoſe who demanded the reaſon why they came ſo late, and chanted ſo diſorderly, that it was to liſten to theſe Hiſtories in the Meadow; wherefore ſeeing their good will, it was permitted to them, that, ſitting at their eaſe, they ſhould every afternoon be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the hedge. Supper being ended, they began the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of the diſcourſe to which they had not put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod in the Meadow.</hi> Oyſilla <hi>at the laſt entreated them that ſhe might retire herſelf, to have her ſpirits more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full againſt the next morning: And after many paſsages full of variety and delight,</hi> Oyſilla <hi>affirming that one hour before midnight was worth three afterwards, this gnllant Company parted, putting an end to their diſcourſe and the recital of their Hiſtories for the ſecond day.</hi>

And if they were content with the foregoing Diſcourſe, they were no leſs taken with this ſecond; and had it not been that one of the Monks had come to call them to the Maſs, their contemplation had hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them from hearing the Bell. Maſs being heard, and a ſhort Dinner ended, that their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories might not be prejudiced by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of too much Viands, they all began in their orders to acquit themſelves as well as they could, and retiring to their Chambers, to read over again their Accounts, they attended the accuſtomed hour to go into the Meadow, which being come, they ſailed not to commence their

This poor Gentleman was a Batchelor, and as often it comes to paſſe, that one unfortunate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is acquainted with another, he courted this poor young Gentlewoman <hi>Rolandine</hi> in the way of Mariage; for their compſexions, fortunes, and conditions were alike, and finding themſelves both to be the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Misfortune, they did ſeek in all places to comfort one another, and by the long ſociety of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, did hold a perfect Correſpondence. Thoſe who had obſerved <hi>Rolandine</hi> ſo retired before, that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119929:111"/>ſhe would not ſpeak with any Man, perceiving her every hour to entertain the Baſtard, did take an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereat, and acquainted her Governeſſe with it, ſaying, It was unſeemly they ſhould be permitted to hold ſuch long Diſcourſe together. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was no ſooner informed of it, but ſhe preſently did declare it unto <hi>Rolandine,</hi> aſſuring her, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>y one did take exceptions that ſhe was alwayes ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to a Man who was not rich enough to marry her, nor handſom enough to be beloved by her. <hi>Rolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine,</hi> who had more often been reproved for her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, than her affability, did make anſwer to her Governeſſe, Alas my Mother! you ſee that I cannot have a Husband according to the honour of the Family from whence I am derived, and that I have always kept company with thoſe who are young and beautifull, and would avoid thoſe Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which I have ſeen others to fall into. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found now this Gentleman to be wiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, (as you cannot deny) what hurt have I done to you, or to thoſe who brought this informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, to comfort my ſelf in my afflictions? The poor old Woman, who loved her better than her ſelf, did reply unto her, Madamoiſelle, I muſt confeſs that you ſpeak the Truth, and that you are otherwiſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Queen, and by your Father, than you do deſerve; but ſo it is, That ſince they ſpeak ſo prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally of your honour, you ought to abſtain from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to him, if he were your own Brother. <hi>Rolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine</hi> weeping, did ſay unto her, Mother, ſince you counſel me, I will obey you; but it ſeems ſtrange to me, to be allowed no Comfort in this World. The Baſtard (according to his Cuſtom) did not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards wait upon her, to whom all along ſhe told the Diſcourſe that ſhe had with her Governeſſe, and weeping, did intreat him, That for a time he would content himſelf until the Rumor were paſſed over, to which, though to his grief, he condeſcended. But in this diſcontinuance of his Company, both the one
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119929:111"/>and the other being deprived of all comfort, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to feel ſo great an anxity of mind, that for her part ſhe had never endured the like before. She cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not continually to pray unto God, to goe in pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, and to obſerve days of Abſtinence. For love as yet unknown unto her did give her ſo much diſquier, that it would not grant her the reſpite of one hour. And on the other ſide, The Baſtard was, poſſeſſed with no leſſe affection, but he who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready concluded in his heart to love her, and to uſe all the means that lay in the compaſſe of his power to marry her, reguarding with his love the honour he ſhould have to enjoy her, did conceive it his beſt way to declare his good will unto the Governeſſe, and to gain her conſent; which he did by remoniſtrating unto her the great miſery in which his poor Miſtreſſe was detain'd, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom they would take away all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. The old woman weeping, did thank him for the honeſt affection which he did bear unto her Miſtreſſe, and did conſult with him of the means by which without being diſcovered they might talk to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which was, that <hi>Rolandine</hi> ſhould counterfeit herſelf to be ſick of a contagious diſeaſe, and when her Companions were all gone from her they two might remain alone, and he might have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak unto her. The Baſtard was very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full at it, and did altogether govern himſelf by the counſel of her Governeſſe, inſomuch that he ſpake unto <hi>Rolandine</hi> as often as he pleaſed; But this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment did not long continue, for the Queen, who never did much care for her, did demand, what wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The Queen who feared that venial ſins in her might by degrees prove to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ones, did ſend to ſee how ſhe did, and did forbid
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:119929:112"/>her to ſpeak any more to the Baſtard, unleſſe it were openly in her chamber of preſence, or in the Hall. The young Lady made not the leaſt appearance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, but made anſwer, that if ſhe had thought that either he or any other had been diſpleaſing to her, ſhe would never have ſpoken the leaſt word unto them. Nevertheleſs ſhe debated with herſelf to find out ſome other means which the Queen ſhould not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, &amp; it was that on <hi>Wednſdays, F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But this meeting could nor be kept ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, but one of the Grooms did obſerve the Baſtard conſtantly to enter into the chamber upon the days when <hi>Rolandine</hi> did keep her faſts, and at laſt it was known to all, and to the Queen herſelf, who was thereupon ſo paſſionate, that the Baſtard after that check durſt never to enter again into the chamber of the Maids: Nevertheleſſe, not to loſe the happineſſe to converſe with her whom ſo much he loved, he often pretended to take a journey out of Town, and on the Evening would return to the Church or to the Chapel at the Court in the habit of a Friar or a Monk, ſo well diſguiſed, that it was impoſſible for any one to know him, and to the ſame Church or Chapel <hi>Rolandine,</hi> with her Governeſs, did not fail to come to entertain him. He obſerving the great love which ſhe did bear unto him, was not afraid to ſpeak unto her. Madam, you know the danger into which I do put my ſelf for your ſervice, and the Queens prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions, that you ſhould ſpeak no more unto me. You know alſo too well, what a Father you have, who ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to whom he ſhall eſpouſe you, you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

I muſt confeſſe I am but a poor man, and that you may marry a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with a fortune far greater than my own; but if love and good will be to be eſteemed a treaſure, I ought to be accounted the richeſt man in the world. God hath indued you with a great eſtate, and you are in a poſſibility to have yet a far greater, if I could be ſo happy, as that you would vonchſafe to chooſe me for your Husband, I would all my life be both a Husband, a Friend, and a Servant to you; and if you ſhould take one equal to your ſelf (which is very hard to do) he would become your maſter, and would more regard your goods than your perſon, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether making it his imployment to be converſant in your eſtate, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The deſire I have to give you this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and the fear which doth ſurpriſe me that you cannot enjoy it with any other, doth cauſe me to beſeech you, that at once you will make me happy, and your ſelf the moſt ſatisfied woman that ever was. <hi>Rolandine</hi> hearing theſe words which ſhe had reſolved with her ſelf to ſpeak unto him, with an aſſured coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance did make anſwer to him. I am very glad that you have begun this diſscourſe which a long time I had thought to have propounded my ſelf unto you. Thoſe two laſt years, ſince I had more perfect knowledge of you, I have thought and thought again, and examined within my ſelf all the reaſons which I could invent, either for you, or againſt you. And at the laſt, reſolving with my ſelf that I would take upon me the eſtate of Marriage, it was time, I conceived, that I ſhould begin to make choice of him with whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I ſhould live beſt, &amp; with moſt peace of mind; I cannot find any one, be he never ſo handſom, ſo rich, or ſo great, that my heart &amp; my ſpirit do ſo well accord with as your ſelf. I know that in marrying you I ſhall not offend God, but do that which he commandeth; And as for Monſieur my Father, he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:119929:113"/>hath ſo little ſought after my Good, nay he hath ſo much refuſed it, that the Law will give leave that I may marry without him, although it lies in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſ-inherit me; Yet let me have but that which belongs unto me, in marrying ſuch a Husband as you are, I ſhall eſteem my ſelf to be the richeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world. As for the Queen my Miſtreſſe, I ought not to make it a point of Conſcience to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe her, to obey God; for ſhe did not forbear to hinder me of that comfort in my youth which I ſhould have enjoyed. But that you may underſtand that the love which I do bear unto you is founded upon Virtue and Honour, you ſhall promiſe faithfully unto me, (that although I do accord unto this marriag) that you ſhall not undertake the conſummation of it until my Father be dead, or until I have found a means to procure his conſent unto it. To this the Baſtard moſt willingly did ingage himſelf, &amp; on theſe promiſes they did give to one another a ring in the obligation of marriage, and kiſſed each other in the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Face of God whom they took to be the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their promiſes, and afterwards, during the ſociety of their loves, there was no other familiarity betwixt them but a kiſſe only.</p>
               <p>This little contentment gave great ſatisfaction to the hearts of thoſe two perfect lovers, and they lived a long time in this aſſurance without being diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any; And there was no place where Honour might be gained to which with great contentment this Baſtard did not goe, being confident that he could never be poor or miſcrable being bleſſed by God in ſo happy and ſo rich a Wiſe, who in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence did ſo well preſerve her perfect love, that ſhe took not the leaſt delight in any man in the world; And although that diverſe did demand her afterwards in marriage, ſhe made no other anſwer to them, but that having ſtayed ſo long without a Husband, ſhe was now reſolved never to marry. This anſwer was given and underſtood by ſo many, that it came at laſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:119929:113"/>to the ear of the Queen, who demanded of her what was the reaſon of it. <hi>Rolandine</hi> made anſwer, That it was to obey her; for ſhe underſtood well enough that ſhe never deſired that ſhe ſhould be married to any, who ſhould not honourably provide for her, and to her own content, and that Age and Patience had inſtructed her to content her ſelf with the Eſtate in which ſhe was. And evermore when they diſcourſed with her concerning Marriage, ſhe did return the like anſwers.</p>
               <p>When the Wars were ended, and the Baſtard en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained again at the Court, ſhe never had any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him before any, but repaired alwayes to the Church to hold Diſcourſe with him there, under the colour of Confeſſion; for the Queen had forbid both him and her to talk together, upon pain of Death: unleſſe it were in ſome great Company. But the Honeſty of Love, which knows no prohibition, was more ready to find means to bring them to ſpeak together, than all their Enemies were prepared to prevent them, and under the habit of all the religious Orders they could deviſe, they entertained their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt love, untill the time that the King made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe to one of his Houſes of pleaſure, which was not ſo near to any Church, as to go on foot to it; ſo that the Ladies were inforced to repair in their Devotions to the Chapel of the Caſtle, which was ſo inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently builded, that there was no place to conceal ones ſelf at the time of Confeilion, and the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor himſelf muſt apparently be ſeen; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, although on the one ſide Opportunity failed them, Love on the other ſide did provide them with a more gratefull Expedient. For there arrived a Lady at the Court who was a neer Kinſwoman of the Baſtards. This Lady, with the young Prince her Son, were lodged in the Houſe of the King, and the Lodgings of the young Prince advanced themſelves all along beyond that part of the Houſe where the King lodged; ſo that the Baſtard might ſee and ſpeak
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119929:114"/>with <hi>Rolandine</hi> out of the Princes window, for the windows did butt forth one againſt another at the Corner of the Houſe. And in that Chamber which was above the Hall of the King, were lodged all the young Ladies of the Nobility who were the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Rolandine;</hi> who oftentimes obſerving the young Prince to look out of the window, did by her Governeſſe advertiſe the Baſtard of it, who having taken a full notice of the place, did pretend to take great pleaſure in reading the Book of the <hi>Knights of the Round Table,</hi> which was in the Chamber of the Prince: And when they were all gone to Dinner, he deſired the Groom of the Chamber to lock him in it, that he might read it over, aſſuring him, that during his abode in the Chamber nothing ſhould be loſt, or diſplaced. The Groom knowing him to be a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of his Maſters, and an honeſt Gentleman, did give him leave to read as long as he pleaſed. On the other ſide, <hi>Rolandine</hi> came to the window of the Maids, and (for no other occaſion but to continue there ſome hours together) did counterfeit to have an infirmity in one of her leggs, and dined and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by her ſelf ſo early, that ſhe did not go to the Ordinary of the young Ladies. She had begun to make a Bed with Crimſon Silk, and did faſten the woof to the window, where ſhe would abide alone; and when ſhe ſaw that there was none in the Room, ſhe entertained her Husband at the window, and when any approached, ſhe would cough, and make a ſign, by which on the other ſide the Baſtard might draw back from being ſeen. Thoſe who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to watch them, did believe for certain that their Love was paſſed over, for ſhe never ſtirred out of her Chamber, where they were ſure the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard durſt not come, becauſe he was expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it by the Queen.</p>
               <p>One day, the Mother of the young Prince being in the Chamber of her Son, did go to the window where the great Book was, and ſtaid there not long,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:119929:114"/>but one of the Companions of <hi>Rolandine,</hi> (who was of her own Chamber) ſeeing the Queen at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow over againſt her, did aſſume the civil boldneſſe to ſalute her, and to ſpeak unto her. The Queen did ask her how <hi>Rolandine</hi> did, ſhe made anſwer to her, That ſhe ſhould ſee her if ſhe pleaſed, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to come to the window, having a Night-kercher on her head, and having ſpoken ſome few words to her concerning her Malady, they did both withdraw. The Queen looking on the great Book of the <hi>Round-Table,</hi> did ſpeak unto the Groom of her Sons Chamber, I do wonder that young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can ſpend their time in reading ſuch follies as theſe. The Groom of the Chamber made anſwer to her, That he more wondred that Gentlemen of Age and Underſtanding ſhould take greater delight to read it, than thoſe of younger years; and to give an Inſtance for his wonder, he aſſured her, That the Baſtard her Cozen would ſtay there four or five hours together, to look on that goodly Book. The Occaſion wherefore it was, did ſuddenly touch the apprehenſion and the heart of the Queen, and ſhe gave a charge to the Groom of the Chamber to hide himſelf in ſome place, to obſerve what the paſſages were, which he did accordingly, and found that the Book which he did read in the window, was <hi>Rolan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the morning he acquainted the Mother of the young Prince with it, who ſent for her Cozen the Baſtard, and after many Reaſons and Remonſtrances did expreſly forbid him to be ſeen there any more.

And when the Means under a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious habit, by which they oftentimes aſſiſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, did fail, he ſent a little Page, ſometimes in one Livery, ſometimes in another, who ſtayed at the door where all the Ladies were to paſſe, and privately in the crowd would deliver his letters unto <hi>Rolandine.</hi> Upon a day when the Queen was gone into the Fields, one of the Spies ſuſpecting the Page, having a charge narrowly to watch him concerning that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, did run after him, but the Page who was as cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as himſelf (doubting that he would examine &amp; ſearch him) did run into the houſe of a poor woman who was making her pot to boyl on the ſire, into which fire he immediatly did thruſt the Letters. The Gentleman who did follow him did ſtrip him naked, and examined his clouths all over, but finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he did let him go.</p>
               <p>When the boy was departed, the old woman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, wherefore ſo rudely he did handle the poor boy. He made anſwer, that it was to find ſome Letters which he thought he had about him. You came not ſoon enough ſaid (the old woman) to find them, for he did hide them where you could not eaſily find them. I pray you (ſaid the Gentleman) tell me where, flattering himſelf with a great hope to

               <p>The Baſtard after this time did never imploy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The old Servant of the Baſtard being wiſe and adviſed, obſerving that a far off they looked upon him, did turn himſelf toward the wall, as if he would make water, and did tear the Letter into as ſmall pieces as poſſibly he could, and threw them behind the door. Immediately he was apprehended and ſearched all over, and when they could find nothing about him, they did put him to Interrogatories upon his oath, if he brought not any Letters, uſing all rigors and perſwaſions that poſſibly they could to make him to confeſſe the Truth, but neither by premiſes nor by threatnings could they draw any confeſſion from him. The Report thereof was made unto the Queen, and ſome of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did give adviſe that it were neceſſary to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the door, neer unto which he was taken, which was done accordingly, and the pieces of the Letters were found for which they ſought. Immediatly the Confeſſor of the King was ſent for, who having put the pieces in order upon the Table, did read the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all along, in which the truth of the marriage, ſo long diſſembled, was perfectly underſtoood, for the Baſtard in many places of it did call her his Wife,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119929:116"/>The Queen who deliberated not with her ſelf to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the fault of her kinſwoman as ſhe ought to doe, did raiſe a great noiſe, and commanded that by all means the poor man ſhould be enforced to confeſſe the truth of the Letter, alleging to him that he could not deny it; but all the perſwaſions they could uſe, and the remonſtrances they could make, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail nothing with him, nor change him from his firſt reſolution.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who had the charge of him did bring him to the Bank of a River, and did put him into a ſack, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he had lyed againſt God and the Queen, and againſt the proved truth: But he who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſe his life, than accuſe his Maſter, did deſire that he might be allowed a Confeſſor, and having ſatisfied his Conſcience as well as he could, he ſaid unto them, Sirs, Tell my Maſter the Baſtard, that I commend unto his care the lives of my Wife, and of my Children, for with a good heart I lay down my own for his ſervice; And do with me now what you pleaſe, for you ſhall never force one word from me, that ſhall be againſt my Maſter.</p>
               <p>Immediatly to put him into a greater fear they did throw him being in the Sack into the water, crying out unto him, If thou wilt ſpeak the Truth thou ſhalt be ſaved, but ſeeing that he would confeſſe nothing, they did draw him out, and made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Conſtancy to the Queen, who immediatly replyed, That neither the King her Husband, nor her ſelf were ſo happy in a Servant, as was this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, who had not wherewith to recompence him, and did what ſhe could to diſſwade him from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but he would never, he ſaid, be inforced to abandon his Maſter. Nevertheleſſe, It being his Maſters deſire, he was afterwards admitted into the ſervice of the King, where he lived well and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Queen, after ſhe underſtood the Truth of the Marriage by the Letter of the Baſtard, did ſend to ſeek out <hi>Rolandine,</hi> and with an angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119929:116"/>did oftentimes, inſtead of Cozen, call her wicked and unfortunate Creature. She ſhewed her the Diſhonour that ſhe had done her Fathers houſe, and to all her Kinred, and to her ſelf alſo, to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without her knowledge and conſent. <hi>Rolandine</hi> who a long time did know the little affection which the Queen did bear unto her, reſolved to anſwer her with the like; and becauſe the Queen was wanting in her love, ſhe was reſolved there ſhould be no place in her own heart for fear; for ſhe knew that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke given to her before ſo many Perſonages, did not proceed from any love, but only to procure her ſhame, as being one whom ſhe took more pleaſure to reproach, than grief to ſee her to tranſgreſſe; She therefore, with a countenance as joyfull and aſſured, as the Queen had ſhewed an angry and a troubled one, did ſay unto her, Madam, If you know not your own heart to be ſuch as it is, I will repreſent unto you the ill will which along time you have born unto <hi>Mounſier</hi> my Father, and to my ſelf, but you know it ſo well, that it cannot be ſtrange unto you, though all the world ſhould doubt it; and for my ſelf (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam) I have a long time perceived it to my great prejudice. For if it had pleaſed you to grace me as much with your favour, as you have done thoſe who are not ſo near unto you as my ſelf, I had been marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your honour and my own; but you have left me as one forgotten in your good opinion, inſomuch that all the good Matches which I might have had, are paſſed from me by the negligence of my Father, and by the little eſteem which you have had of me, by reaſon whereof I do find my ſelf ſo forlorn, that if my health had permitted me to take upon me the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Nun, I had moſt willingly put on that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious habit, to free my ſelf from thoſe continuall afflictions, which your rigour hath impoſed upon me. In this deſpair, it was my fortune to find out him who was of as good and as great a Family as my ſelf. He hath a long time loved and courted me; but you
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119929:117"/>Madam (who never pardoned me for the leaſt fault, nor commended me for the greateſt good) although by experience you do know, that I am not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to maintain any diſcourſe of love, or of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this world, and that I was altogether retired from it, being reſolved to lead that life which was moſt religious, doe now find it ſtrange, that I ſhould ſpeak unto a Gentleman as unfortunate as my ſelf, in whoſe love I neither deſired nor ſought for any thing, but only ſome relaxation of my ſpirit. Of which when altogether I beheld my ſelf to be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I did enter into ſuch a deſpair, that I had as great a reſolution to procure ſome caſe unto my ſelf, as you had a deſire to take it from me; And not long after, we entred into a diſcourſe of marriage, which was conſummated by mutual promiſes, and by the Ceremony of a Ring. Wherefore Madam, it ſeems to me that you do me a great wrong to call me wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſeeing that in ſo great and perfect a love I could find occaſion if I would, to doe evil, which I do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, for there hath been never betwixt him and my ſelf any other privacy but to kiſſe only, hoping that God would ſo bleſſe my undertakings, that before the publick celebration of my marriage, I ſhould gain the heart of my Father to conſent unto it. I have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offended God nor my Conſcience; For I have attended unto the age of thirty years to ſee what you and Monſieur my Father would doe for me, having preſerved my youth in ſo much chaſtity, that no man living can in the leaſt manner reproach me. And by the counſel of that reaſon which God hath given me, ſeeing my ſelf growing into age, I determined with my ſelf to eſpouſe one according to my own heart, nor to ſatisfie the concupiſcence of my eyes (for you know he is not handſom) nor the deſires of the fleſh (for I doe hope he is not carnally given) nor to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie my ambition, or the pride of this life (for he is but poor and unadvanced) but I look purely and ſincerely upon the Virtue, the Honeſty, and the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:119929:117"/>that are in him, for which all the world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends him, and on the great love which he bears unto me, which doth cauſe me to hope that I ſhall find comfort and good uſe with him; and having well conſidered with my ſelf all the good, and all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils that could arrive unto me by him, I have taken that part which did ſeem to be the beſt unto me, and which I have looked up in my heart theſe two years and more, which is, to lay out all the remainder of my life in his company. And I am determined to hold this reſolution ſo firm, that all the torments I can endure, be it death it ſelf, ſhall never cauſe me to ſtartle from this reſolution: Wherefore Madam, Be pleaſed to excuſe that in me, which is moſt excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, as your ſelf no doubt doe well underſtand, and give me leave to live in that peace which I doe hope to enjoy with him.</p>
               <p>The Queen beholding her countenance ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and finding her words ſo true, could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer her according unto reaſon, but continuing her chole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But if h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> King and your Father would take my counſel, they ſhould ſend you into another place, where you ſhould be conſtrained to ſpeak words of another ſenſe. Madam, (ſaid <hi>Rolandine</hi>) becauſe you accuſe me of ſpeaking too boldly, I am reſolved to hold my peace, if that you are not pleaſed to give me leave to ſpeak, and anſwer you. When ſhe had received commandment to ſpeak, ſhe ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her; Madam, Far be it from me to ſpeak boldly, and without reverence to you, who are my Miſtreſſe, and the greateſt Princeſſe in Chriſtendom, I have not the leaſt thought ſo to doe; but becauſe I have no Advocate to plead for me, but the truth only
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119929:118"/>which I my ſelf do know, I am bound to declare it without fear, hoping that when it is well underſtood by you, you will not eſteem me to be ſuch as you call me. I fear not, that any mortal creature under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how I have carried my ſelf in the affair I am charged with, ſhould condemn me for it, for I know that God and my Honor are not offended in it. And but be pleaſed to conſider what it is that makes me to ſpeak without fear; It is an aſſurance that he who ſees my heart is with me, and ſince I have ſo great and ſo juſt a Judge for me, I ſhould offend if I ſhould fear thoſe who are ſubject to his Judgement; And wherefore then, <hi>Madam,</hi> ought I to weep, ſince neither my conſcience nor my honour do any ways reprove me for this fact, and that I am ſo far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I were to begin it again, I would do no otherwiſe than what I have done. But you (Madam) have a great occaſion to weep, as well for the many great injuries which you have done me from my firſt youth hitherto, as for that which you do me at this preſent, in rebuking me for a fault before all the world, which ought more to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to you than to my ſelf. If I had offended God, the King, you, my Parents, or my Conſcience, I ſhould appear very obſtinate, if I ſhould not melt in repentance for ſo great a fault; But for a good cauſe, which is juſt and holy, and which alwayes carried with it an honourable report (unleſſe you have too much undervalued it, and made it an offence, which ſheweth the deſire you have to deprave me to be greater than your endeavour to preſerve or advance the honour of your houſe and kinred) I have no reaſon to weep at all. But, Madam, ſince it doth pleaſe you, I will not contradict it; For albeit that you inflict upon me what puniſhment you pleaſe, I ſhall take no leſſe pleaſure without reaſon to ſuffer it, than you ſhall take without reaſon to command it. Wherefore, Madam, doe you and my Eather give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ſhall be the torment I am to endure, for I know he will not be wanting to you, and I ſhall be
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119929:118"/>glad at leaſt, that for my puniſhment only he doth altogether follow your will, and having been negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for my good, yet (it being your deſire) that he is ready for my evil, to be obedient to you, But I have a Father in Heaven, who I am confident will give me as much patience, as I ſee there are afflictions prepared by you for me, and in him alone I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect confidence.</p>
               <p>The Queen being full of anger and in dignation to hear thoſe words to proceed from her, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that ſhe ſhould be taken away from before her, and put in a chamber by her ſelf, where not any ſhould be permitted to ſpeak unto her, but they took not her Governeſſe from her, by the means whereof ſhe acquainted the Baſtard with the whole progreſſe of her fortunes, and deſired to be informed of him what ſhe ought to doe; who conceiving that his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the Kings ſervice were of ſome value to render him acceptable unto him, did with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence repair unto the Court, and finding the King in the fields, he acquainted him with the truth of the fact, and beſought him that he would doe him (being a poor Gentleman) ſo great a pleaſure as to appeaſe the Queen, and be a means that the marriage might publickly be ſolemnized. The King made no other anſwer to him, but only demanded; Do you aſſure me that you have married her? yes, Sir, ſaid the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, but by words and a contract only; and if you pleaſe the full period will be put unto it. The King did hold down his head, and without ſpeaking any word returned directly unto the Caſtle, and when he came neer unto it he called the Captain of the Guard, and commanded him to take the Baſtard pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. Immediatly one of his friends, who obſerved the countenance of the King, did adviſe the Baſtard to abſent himſelf, and to withdraw into a houſe of his not far from thence, and if the King commanded him to be ſought out (as he ſuſpected he would) that immediatly he ſhould have notice of it that he might
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119929:119"/>provide for his own ſafety by his ſlight out of the Kingdom, but if the King ſeemed not to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he would ſend him word to return to the Court. The Baſtard did believe him, and his diligence made ſuch diſpatch that the Captain of the Guard could not find him. The King and the Queen did take counſel together what they ſhould do with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landine,</hi> who had the honour to be their Kinſwoman, and by the counſel of the Queen it was concluded, that ſhe ſhould be ſent unto her Father, to whom the whole truth of the buſineſſe was to be declared. But before ſhe did goe, it was ordered, that diverſe of the Kings Counſel, and ſome alſo of the Church ſhould repreſent unto her, that as yet there had paſſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in her marriage but her word only, and that ſhe might eaſily recall herſelf, if both one of them and the other would alter their opinions, and their loves, and diſclaiming all intereſts, make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of no effect.</p>
               <p>This the King deſired that ſhe would do, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the honout of the houſe of which ſhe was, but ſhe made anſwer, that in all other things ſhe was both obliged and ready to obey the King, but in this only which ſo nearly concern'd her conſcience ſhe deſired to be excuſed, alleging, that thoſe whom God had put together ought not to be ſeparated by men, and deſired that ſhe might not be tempted to ſo unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable a thing; for if love and good will grounded on the fear of God is the true and ſure tye of Marriage, ſhe was tyed ſo faſt, that neither Steel, nor Fire, nor Water could either break or conſume that bond, but death only, to whom alone, and to none elſe ſhe was reſolved to ſurrender her oath and her ring, beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them not to urge her to the contrary, for ſhe was ſo firm in her reſolution, that ſhe had rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh keeping her ſaith, than live having infringed it. Thoſe who were deputed by the King made the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port unto him of her conſtancy, and when they ſaw they could provide no remedy to cauſe her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119929:119"/>her husband, they carried her to her Father, in that pitiful manner, that whereſoever ſhe paſſed they did all fall on weeping to behold her; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe had her failings in this contract, yet ſo great was her puniſhment, and ſo ſtrong her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, that ſhe made her fault to be eſteemed a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Her Father, hearing this unwelcom news, would not ſee her, but ſent her to a Caſtle of his in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, which he had builded for another occaſion, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be declared after this Novel. He kept her there a long time in priſon, and ſent her word often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that if ſhe would forſake her Husband he would account her for his daughter, and ſet her at liberty; Nevertheleſſe ſhe always did hold firm in her deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, &amp; loved better the place of her priſon, and the miſeries ſhe endured for her Husband, than all the liberty of the world without him; and it ſeemed to thoſe who did behold her, that all her puniſhments were but pleaſant recreations, becauſe ſhe ſuffered them for him whom ſo intirely ſhe affected. What ſhall I ſay, in this place, of men? The Baſtard, who (as you have heard) was ſo much obliged to her, did fly into <hi>Germany,</hi> where he had many friends, and ſhewed by his Inconſtancy, that not Truth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Love, but Avarice and Ambition did perſwade him to the marriage of <hi>Rolandine;</hi> Inſomuch that in a ſhort time after, he grew ſo amorous of a <hi>German</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that by his Letters he did forget to viſit her, who ſuſtained ſo many tribulations for him; For Fortune (as rigorous as ſhe was unto them) did never take from them the means to write to one another: but the heart of <hi>Rolandine</hi> had (of its ſelf) the firſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fooliſh love into which the Baſtard was fall'n, ſo that ſhe could not take any reſt, for ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the language in his Letters was ſo cold, and ſo much altered, that they nothing reſembled thoſe hearty expreſſions which ſhe was accuſtomed to receive from him, ſhe therefore truly did ſuſpect that ſome new love had diverted her Husband from
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119929:120"/>her, and when all the puniſhments and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhe endured could nor work the leaſt change in her at all; and becauſe her perfect love would not allow that ſhe ſhould ground her judgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſuſpition, ſhe did contrive a way to ſend privat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſervant of hers in whom ſhe truſted (not to ſpeak unto him, or bring any Letters from him) but ſtrictly to obſerve him, and to relate the truth. He being returned from his Journey told her, that for certain he found the Baſtard paſſionatly amorous of a <hi>German</hi> Lady, and the report was, that he did court her in way of marriage, for ſhe was very rich.</p>
               <p>This news did convey ſo extreme a grief to the heart of poor <hi>Rolandine,</hi> that being unable to endure it, ſhe fell grievouſly ſick. Thoſe who underſtood the occaſion did acquaint her, that ſince ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the great inconſtancy of the Baſtard, ſhe might now juſtly abandon him, and did the uttermoſt they could to perſwade her to it; but notwithſtanding ſhe was thus tormented, to the laſt they could find no means to make her change her reſolution: And in this laſt temptation, to the great commendation of her virtue, ſhe did manifeſt the abſolute love which ſhe did bear him. For as love did diminiſh on his ſide, ſo it did increaſe on hers, and did continue firm, when he had no intire nor perfect love, for love which failed on his ſide did turn on her ſide, and when ſhe knew that the love was intire in her alone, which before was divided betwixt them both, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to preſerve it to her death, both for him and her ſelf. Wherefore the Divine bounty, who is perfect charity and true love, had pity on her griefs, and did regard her patience, inſomuch that after a few days the Baſtard dyed in purſute of another woman; ſhe being well advertiſed of his death by thoſe who ſaw him laid in the earth, did ſend unto her Father to beſeech him that he would be pleaſed to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, who having not ſpoken to her ſince the time of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119929:120"/>her impriſonment, did immediatly repair unto her, and having all along underſtood her juſt reaſons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of reproving her, and killing her (as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he threatned in his words) he took her in his Arms, and weeping abundantly, ſaid unto her; My daughter, you are more righteous than my ſelf, for if there were any fault in you, I was the principal cauſe: But ſince God hath ſo ordained it, I will give you ſatisfaction with advantage for the time to come; and having brought her into his houſe, he did uſe her as his only child.</p>
               <p>She was at laſt demanded in marriage by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of her Fathers own name, and who gave with him the ſame Coat of arms, who was a wiſe and a virtuous man, and ſo highly eſteemed <hi>Rolandine,</hi> that he praiſed her for that, for which other men did blame her, knowing that the end did only tend unto virtue. The marriage was agreeable both to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and <hi>Rolandine,</hi> and was immediatly concluded. True it is, that a Brother which ſhe had, who was the only heir of the houſe, would not agree that ſhe ſhould have any part in the Eſtate, objecting againſt her that ſhe had been diſobedient to her Father, and after the death of the good Man, he did deport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo churliſhly unto her, that her Husband, (who was but a younger brother) and her ſelf had enough to do to live, for which God provided, for the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who would needs have all, by a ſudden death did leave unto her all the Fortunes which he had of hers, and of his own with it. And thus was ſhe the Heireſſe of a very great Eſtate, and lived honourably and holily in her husbands love; And after ſhe had brought up two children which God had given her, ſhe rendred with joy her Soul to him, of whom for a long time ſhe had ſuch perfect knowledge.</p>

                  <hi>Now my Ladies, I would deſire that thoſe men who do declare us to be ſo inconſtant, would come hither, and ſhew me as good a Husband, as this was a wife, and ſuch a faith and perſeverance; I am confident it would be ſo
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:119929:121"/>difficult unto them, that I had rather acquit them than put them to ſuch an endleſse task; But I muſt beſeech you La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, by the luſtre of this example to continue your glory, &amp; not to love at all, or as perfectly as this Lady did, and to have a care that your honours be not ſcandaliz'd, ſince by her firmneſſe and conſtancy, ſhe is an occaſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe yours. In good earneſt</hi> Parlament (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>you have reported to us the ſtory of a Lady, who had a great and an honeſt heart, and who gained as much glory by her conſtancy, as her Husband contracted ſhame by his diſloyalty, who did leave her for another. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (ſaid</hi> Longaren) <hi>that this affliction was too grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be endured; for there is no burthen ſo heavy, but the love of two perſons well united may ſweetly undergoe it; but when one of them doth fail, and lays all the charge upon the other, the weight is inſupportable. You ought then (ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>to have compaſſion on us who carry all the love, and doe not deign of your ſelves ſo much as to put one finger forth to aſſiſt us. Ah</hi> Guebron (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>the burthens of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and the Wife doe often differ much; For the love of the Wife being well grounded, and depending upon God, and on her Honour, is ſo juſt and reaſonable, that he who parts himſelf from that love ought to be eſteemed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate man, and guilty before God, and all honeſt men: But the love of the moſt part of men is grounded only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pleaſure, and ignorant Women are oftentimes too prone to ſerve their looſe deſires; but when God doth inſtruct them to underſtand the wickedneſſe of the hearts of thoſe men whom they eſteemed to be good, they will leave them with honour and reputation. The knowledge of the ſin doth leave a greater guilt upon the Conſcience.</hi> Hircan <hi>replyed, A goodly reaſon indeed! grounded on a fancy that honeſt women may honeſtly leave the love of their Husbands, and not honeſt men the love of their Wives, becauſe forſooth their hearts you ſay are different; but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are, and that they doe differ as much as the countenances and the habits of men do differ from thoſe of women, yet I believe their affections and wills are
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:119929:121"/>both alike; unleſſe they differ in this, that their follies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more covered are alwayes the worſe.</hi> Parlament <hi>in a little choler ſaid unto him, I underſtand well enough that you eſteem thoſe to be leaſt evil, whoſe intentions are moſt diſcovered.</hi>

I do give it ſaid ſhe to</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron. <hi>Before I doe begin (ſaid he) to ſpeak of the Grey Fryers, I muſt not forget thoſe of the order of Saint</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict, <hi>and what befell unto two of them in my time; Howſoever, in giving you an account of a man wickedly religious, It is not my intent to alter your good opinion, which you ought to have to thoſe of them, who are reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious indeed. But ſince the Pſalmiſt ſays, that</hi> every man is a lyar; <hi>And in another place, that</hi> there are none that do good, no not one, <hi>It ſeems to me that we cannot erre in eſteeming Man to be ſuch as be is; For if there be any thing good in him, we ought to attribute it to him who is the original of all good, and not unto the Creature, in giving too much praiſe and glory to it, or in eſteeming better of men than indeed they are, the greateſt part of men are deceived and deceivers: And to the end that you may ſee, it is not impoſſible under an extreme ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to find an extreme concupiſcence, underſtand what not long ſince happened in the time of King</hi> Francis <hi>the firſt of that name.</hi>

               <p>IN the City of <hi>Paris</hi> there was a Prior of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> in the Fields, whoſe name I will conceal for the love which I have born unto him. His life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he was fifty years of age was ſo auſtere, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his holineſſe was ſpread over all the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> inſomuch that there was neither Prince nor Princeſſe but entertained him with all honour and reverence when he came to ſee them; And there was no Reformation of Religion but it paſſed firſt through his hand, for he was call'd, the Father of true religion.

And having for certain years continued this wicked courſe of life, the Divine goodneſſe which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the poor miſguided ſheep would no longer indure the ravening of this treacherous Fox; For one day going to viſit a Covent not far from <hi>Paris</hi> called <hi>Gif,</hi> it fell out, that in confeſſing all the holy Nuns he took an eſpecial notice of one Siſter called <hi>Mary He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouet,</hi> whoſe language was ſo pleaſant &amp; agreeable, to him, that it promiſed her face and her heart would be the ſame; Wherefore but to hear her ſpeak only, he was ſtruck with ſuch a feaver of love, that it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all paſſions which he ever had for any other of theſe religious women, and ſpeaking to her, he held down his head very low, that the better he might obſerve her, and perceiving her lip to be plump and red, he could not forbear to lift up her vail to ſee if her eyes were the Companions of thoſe beauties that were about them; which he found to be true; whereupon his heart was filled with ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent a heat, that he forgot to eat and drink, and ſuddenly loſt his complexion, although he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the occaſion of it. Being returned to his Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he could take no reſt; wherefore in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity he paſſed away the days and nights, ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching out the means by which he might arrive to his deſires, and make of her as he had made of diverſe others; this he found difficult to be performed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found her wiſe in all her anſwers, and of a ſubtil ſpirit, and on the other ſide being above threeſcore years of age, he found himſelf ſo old and ſo wrizled, that he reſolved with himſelf not to ſpeak to her at all, but to make an attempt to gain
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119929:123"/>her by fear. Wherefore, not long afterwards, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the ſaid Monaſtery of <hi>Gif,</hi> in which place he ſhewed himſelf more ſevere than ever before he was accuſtomed to do: he grew angry with all the Religious Women, reproving one for not wearing her veil low enough, another, for holding up her head too high, a third, for not making her Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie with that Reverence as ſhe ought to do, and in theſe ſmall trifles he ſhewed himſelf ſo ſevere, that they ſtood in the greateſt fear of him that could be.</p>
               <p>Having don this, he travelled to viſit the other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Regulation, and about the hour of Veſpers he came again to the Dormitory where theſe Nuns were. The Abbeſſe ſaid unto him, Reverend Father, It is time to go to Veſpers. To whom he anſwered, Go Mother, go, for I am ſo weary that I will ſtay here, not ſo much to reſt my ſelf, as to ſpeak to Siſter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> of whom I have heard a very bad Report, for I am told, That ſhe goes up and down and prattles, as if ſhe were one of the wide world. The Abbeſſe who was neer of Kin to her Mother, did deſire him to ſchool her well for it, and left her alone with him, ſave only a little Girl, who being very young was newly entred into the Religion, and ſtood at the furtheſt door. When he found himſelf all alone with Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> he did begin to take off, her veil, and commanded her to look upon him; She made anſwer, that her Rule did forbid her to look on any Man. It is true my Child (ſaid the Prior) but you ought not to think, that we who are men of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are to be comprehended in that Rule. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> fearing to commit a fault by diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, did look in the face of him, which ſhe ſaw ſo extremely warped and ill-favoured, that ſhe thought with her ſelf, ſhe did rather Penance, than commit a Sin to behold him. The Prior having held her in a long diſcourſe of the Love he did bear unto her, did offer to put his hand upon her Breſts, but ſhe did
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119929:123"/>thruſt it back as ſhe ought to do, and grew ſo impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, that he ſaid unto her, What? And will not the Nuns be known that they have Breſts? She made anſwer to him, I know I have; and am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with my ſelf; that neither you, nor any one elſe ſhall touch them; for I am not ſo young nor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, but I underſtand well enough what is ſin, and what is not. When he found he could not gain her that way, he attempted another, and ſaid unto her, Alas! (my Daughter) I am put to that diſtreſſe, that I muſt declare unto you my Neceſſity, which is, that I have an infirmity which the Phyſicians do all of them find to be incurable, unleſſe I do delight my ſelf, and play with a Woman whom I love very well; For my ſelf, I had rather die than commit any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin, but if I muſt venture ſo far, I know that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication and the ſins of Luſt are no wayes to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the ſin of Man-ſlaughter: Wherefore if you love my life, you may both ſave it, and ſave your Conſcience alſo from the ſtain of cruelty. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, What kind of play it was that he did mean? He told her, That it was to put his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon hers, and that ſhe ſhould do nothing, in which he would not joyn with her in the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: And to ſhew her the beginning of the Paſtime which he demanded, he did imbrace her, and endeavoured to throw her on one of the Beds in the Dormitory. She perceiving his wicked Intention, did ſo well defend her ſelf by the ſoftnes of her words, and the ſtrength of her Arms, that he could touch nothing of her but her cloaths. The Prior, when he beheld all his deſignes, and the force he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to be fruſtrated, like a man poſſeſſed with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and as much beſides his Reaſon as his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did put his hands under her Coates, and whatſoever he could touch with his fingers, he ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with his nails, with ſo much violence, that the poor Girl crying out as loud as ever ſhe could, did fall down from the height where ſhe was, and lay as
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119929:124"/>one quite dead upon the ground. The Abbeſſe, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to ſhriek, immediatly entred into the Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitory where ſhe was, and being then at Veſpers, ſhe remember'd that ſhe had left her alone with her Confeſſor, and having thereupon a ſcruple in her Conſcience, ſhe made all the haſt ſhe could to the Door of the Dormitory, to liſten what they were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but hearing the voice and complaints of her Niece, ſhe knocked at the Door where the young Nun her Companion ſtayed, and when ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred in, the Prior beholding the Abbeſſe, did ſhew her her Kinſwoman lying on the ground, and ſaid unto her, Mother, Without all doubt you are very much to blame, that you did not acquaint me with the conditions of Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> for being ignorant of her weakneſs, I had her in confeſſion before me, and in chaptering her, ſhe hath ſwouned away as you ſee: They quickly brought her to her ſelf again with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar and other Remedies, and found that in her fall ſhe had extremely hurt her head. When ſhe was recovered again to life, the Prior fearing that ſhe would confeſſe unto her Aunt the occaſion of her E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, did call her aſide, and ſpoke unto her by her ſelf, My Daughter, I command you upon the pain of diſobedience and eternal Damnation, that you neither now, nor ever hereafter, do ſpeak the leaſt word unto the Abbeſſe of what I have ſaid or done unto you, for you are to underſtand that the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Love did force me to it, and becauſe I ſee you will not conſent unto me, I will never ſpeak any more unto you; howſoever I aſſure you, That if you will love me, I will procure that you ſhall be made an Abbeſſe in one of the beſt Abbeys of the Kingdom. She made anſwer to him, That ſhe had rather die in perpetual Durance, than to have any other friend but him only who dyed on the Croſſe for her, with whom ſhe had rather ſuffer all the torments that the world could inflict upon her, than without him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all the pleaſures it could beſtow, and deſired him
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119929:124"/>to make no more any ſuch looſe motions to her, for if he did, ſhe would acquaint her Mother the Abbeſſe with it, but if he would deſiſt, ſhe would hold her peace concerning what had paſſed.</p>
               <p>In this manner this ungracious Paſtor did depart, who to ſhew himſelf to be another Man than he was, and to enjoy the pleaſure a little longer of ſeeing her whom he ſo much loved, did turn to the Abbeſſe, and ſaid unto her, Mother, I pray you to command all your Daughters to ſing one <hi>Salve Regina</hi> in the honour of that Virgin in whom I have all my hope. This was done accordingly, during which time this Fox did nothing elſe but weep, with no other Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for a wicked grief only that he could not have his deſires on that Virgin whom he accounted to have made his own. The Nuns obſerving his Tears, ſuppoſed that it was in love to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and eſteemed him to be a moſt holy Man. But Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> who knew his ill intentions, did pray to God in heart to confound him, who ſo much would diſhonour, and did deſpiſe Virginity.</p>
               <p>The Hymn being ended, this Hypocrite returned to St. <hi>Martins,</hi> in which place the unruly fire which he had in his heart, did burn day and night, and where he ſtudied all the wayes that poſſibly he could, to arrive to his Deſignes. And becauſe above all things he feared the Abbeſſe, who was a very virtuous woman, he contrived a way to remove her from that Monaſtery, and repaired to Madam <hi>de Vendoſm,</hi> who was then at <hi>La Fere,</hi> where ſhe founded and builded a Covent for the Order of St. <hi>Benedict,</hi> called <hi>Mount Olivet;</hi> And as one who was the Soveragin Reformer of all things in Religion, he did give her to underſtand, that the Abbeſſe of <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> was not fit to govern ſo great a place. The good Lady deſired him to name another who was more worthy of the office. He, who deſired nothing more, did adviſe her to take the Abbeſſe of <hi>Giff,</hi> who was the moſt able Governeſſe in all <hi>France.</hi> Madam <hi>de Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſm</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:119929:125"/>did immediatly ſend for her, and gave her the charge of the Monaſtery of <hi>Mount Olivet.</hi> The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of St. <hi>Martins</hi> who had in his power the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moſt of the religious places for women about <hi>Paris,</hi> did procure that a Governeſſe at his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion ſhould be choſen for the Abbey of <hi>Gif.</hi> After this election he did repair to <hi>Gif</hi> to try once more, if either by humility of intreaties, or by the flattery of fair words he could gain unto him the heart of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mary Herouet,</hi> and finding her as refractory to him as ever, he returned in great deſpair to his Prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> in which place, the better to come to his ends, as alſo to revenge himſelf on her who was ſo cruel to him, and for fear alſo that his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence ſhould be divulged, he plotted with himſelf that the reliques of the Saints of <hi>Gif</hi> ſhould privately be taken away by ſtealth, and that a Confeſſor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to that houſe, a very antient and an honeſt man, ſhould be accuſed to have been the man that had ſtoll'n them, for which cauſe he was brought priſoner to St. <hi>Martins;</hi> during which time he ſtirred up two witneſſes, who ignorantly ſigned to that which the Prior of St. <hi>Martins</hi> did command them, which was, that in the garden they had ſeen the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor with Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> and taken them in the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and diſhoneſt act of luſt, which they did avow to the old religious man; But he who knew all the faults of the Prior, did beſeech him to bring him to the Chapiter, and that there before the whole order he would ſpeak the truth of all what he did know. The Prior fearing that the Juſtication of the Frier would be his own condemnation, would not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that requeſt, but finding him intractable to his deſign, he did uſe him very cruelly in priſon, where ſome affirm that he dyed, others, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained him to abandon his religious habit, and to depart the Kingdom of <hi>France;</hi> howſoever it was, he was never ſeen afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Prior with confidence believed now that he
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:119929:125"/>might make a Prize of Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> and repaired to the Covent, the Abbeſſe whereof being of his own Complexion, and put in by his requeſt, would not contradict him in any thing. Here he began to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe his authority of Viſitation, and made all the Nuns to come to him into the Chamber one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to Viſit, and to hear them apart, after the manner of Confeſſion, and Viſitation. And when it came to the turn of Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> (who had loſt her good Aunt the former Governeſſe,) he begun to ſay unto her, Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> you know of what Crime you are accuſed, and that the diſſimulation you have uſed to be ſo chaſt, hath ſerved you in no ſtead; for it is known wel enough that you lead a life clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> with an aſſured countenance made anſwer to him, Procure that my accuſers may be brought before me, and you ſhall ſee if they dare to juſtifie before my face, what you object unto me. He made anſwer to her, There needs no other proof, for the Confeſſor himſelf hath been convinced. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mary</hi> replyed, I conceive him to be ſo honeſt a Man, that he will not confeſſe ſuch a notorious falſhood; but if it be ſo, I pray let us be brought face to face, and I will prove that what he ſaith to be contrary to the Truth. The Prior obſerving that ſhe would no way be daunted, did ſay unto her, I am your Father, and for that cauſe have a deſire to ſave your honour, I will therefore remit the Truth to your own Conſcience, and will adde my belief unto it. But I do command you, and conjure you, upon the pain of Mortal ſin, to tell me the Truth, which is, If you were a Virgin when you firſt came into this Houſe. She made anſwer to him, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, The Age but of Six years, at which I then was, ſhall be a Witneſſe with me of my Virginity. He replyed, You ſay well, my Daughter, but ſince that time have you not loſt that fair flower? She did ſwear unto him, that ſhe had not, nor had ever the leaſt ſollicitation by any one, but by himſelf only.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119929:126"/>To which he ſaid, That he could not believe it, and that it lay in the proof. She replyed, What proof are you pleaſed to make of it? The Prior ſaid, The ſame proof which I make of others; for as I am a Viſitor of Souls, ſo am I alſo a Viſitor of Bodies; your Abbeſſes, and Prioreſſes, do paſſe all under the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my hand, you need not to fear that I deſire your Virginity. Wherefore, that I may be aſſured of it, make no more to do, but lie down upon the Bed, and pull up your cloaths over your face? Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Mary</hi> in choler made anſwer to him, You have held me ſo long in a vain diſcourſe with the fooliſh love you bear me, that I am afraid you will rather take away my Virginity, than viſit it; Wherefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in this I will never conſent unto you. He then aſſured her that ſhe ſhould be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, for refuſing obedience to the Religion; and that if ſhe conſented not, he would diſhonour her in a full Chapiter, <hi>or Aſſembly of the Religious, being met together for that purpoſe,</hi> and would moreover reveal the ſhame which he knew betwixt her &amp; her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. But ſhe with a Countenance without fear, made anſwer, He who knoweth the heart of his Servants will give me as much honour before him, as you will render me ſhame before Men: And ſince your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is gon ſo far, I had rather that it ſhould go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough with its cruelty towards me, than that it ſhould have a deſire ſtill to do me miſchief, for I know that God is a juſt Judge. Immediatly he departed to gather all the Chapiter together, who being aſſembled, he forced Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> to fall on her knees before them, to whom in a great ſpight and choler he ſaid, Siſter <hi>Mary,</hi> It doth greatly diſpleaſe me, that the good admonitions which I have often given you have been unprofitable, and that you are brought to ſuch an Inconvenience, that I am conſtrained to enjoyn you Penance againſt my Cuſtom, which is, that having examined your Confeſſor of what was laid to his charge, he hath confeſſed to me, That he
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119929:126"/>hath abuſed your body, in the place where the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes do affirm that they did ſee him. Wherefore, as you have been advanced into an honorable eſtate, and made Miſtreſs of the Novices, I ordain, That you ſhall not only be made the loweſt of them all, but that ſitting on the Ground before all the Siſters, you ſhall feed on bread and water, until I ſhall find, that your Contrition is ſufficient to obtain favour and abſolution.</p>
               <p>Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> being advertiſed by one of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who underſtood all the buſineſſe, that if ſhe anſwered any thing which diſpleaſed the Prior, he would put her <hi>in pace,</hi> that is to ſay, in perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, did endure that heavy Sentence, lifting up her eyes to Heaven, and beſeeching him who gave her reſiſtance, to give her patience alſo in this great tribulation. Moreover, this venerable Prior did give order (if her Mother, or any of her Kinred came to ſee her) that they ſhould ſuffer none of them to ſpeak with her for the ſpace of three years, and that ſhe ſhould not be permitted to ſend any Letters to them, but what were written before Company, and firſt peruſed by them. And thus this wicked Frier departed from her, without returning any more, and the poor Girl remained in a long tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you have heard.</p>
               <p>But her Mother, who loved her better than any child ſhe had, ſeeing that ſhe could hear nothing of her, did greatly wonder at the cauſe of it, and told one of her Sons (who was an honeſt and a knowing Gentleman) That ſhe believed her Daughter was dead, and that the Abbeſſe, and thoſe in the Covent did diſſemble it, becauſe they would ſtill receive her annual Penſion; ſhe therefore deſired him to uſe one means or other, whatſoever it were, to ſee his Siſter. He immediatly tepaired to the Covent of <hi>Gif,</hi> where they made him the accuſtomed excuſe, which was, That it was above three years and more ſince ſhe ſtirred out of her Bed: But this did not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119929:127"/>content him, who did ſwear unto them, That if he could not be allowed to ſee her, he would make his way over the walls, and force the Monaſtery. At which they were ſo amazed, that they brought his Siſter to the Grate to him, but the Abbeſſe ſtood ſo near unto her, that ſhe could not ſpeak the leaſt word to her Brother, which ſhe did not plainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; but ſhe who was wiſe enough, did give him what ſhe had prepared in writing, which was a Narrative of all that which above I have rehearſed, with a thouſand other Inventions which the Prior had put in practiſe to deceive her, which I forbear to repeat. But yet I cannot forget, that during the time when her Aunt was Abbeſſe, he conceiving with himſelf that ſhe did refuſe him by reaſon of the deformity and the crookedneſſe of his Age, did cauſe her to be tempted by a handſom young Frier, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if ſhe yeelded to the Frier for Love, ſhe ſhould yeeld obedience unto him for Fear; But ſhe from the Garden (where the Frier courted her, and uſed ſuch uncivil geſtures, that I am aſhamed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them) did run to the Abbeſſe, who was talking unto the Prior, and ſaid unto her, Mother, Thoſe who come to viſit us, are Devils in the ſtead of Saints, whereupon the Prior being afraid to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, did ſpeak in laughter to her, Mother, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> hath good reaſon for it, and taking her by the hand, he ſaid before the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſſe, I underſtood by divers, that Siſter <hi>Mary</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her mind in ſuch prompt words, and with ſuch a gracefull flouriſh, as if ſhe had received her Education rather at the Court, than at a Covent, and for this occaſion I was conſtrained, againſt my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to diſcourſe with her in the idſe way, as Men of the World do ordinarily with Women, and as I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind it written in their Books (for in my own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence I am as ignorant as the Day in which I was born) and becauſe I conceived that my Age and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eformity were the occaſions, that ſhe entertained
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:119929:127"/>me always with ſuch a virtuous diſcourſe, I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a religious young Man to hold ſuch conference with her, as I thought was moſt ſuitable to her, and you ſee ſhe hath very virtuouſly reſiſted the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon whereof I do eſteem her to be ſo wiſe, that it is my pleaſure, that for the time to come ſhe ſhall be next unto you, and Miſtreſſe of the Novices, to the end that ſhe may daily advance her ſelf in her good endeavours, and increaſe more and more in virtue.</p>
               <p>This Prank, and many others like unto it, this good Prior did play for the ſpace of three years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, when he was amorous of her, who (as I have ſaid) did give unto her Brother in a Paper through the Grate, all the diſcourſe of her dolefull Hiſtory; Her Brother immediatly brought it to his Mother, who, overcome with the indignity of it, did come to <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe found the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Siſter of the King, to whom ſhe repreſented the Truth of this pitifull Story, and ſaid unto her, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, For the time to come truſt no more to ſuch Hypocrites, I thought I had my Daughter in the High-way to Heaven, and the Suburbs of Paradiſe, and I have put her into Hell, and into the Hands of the worſt Devils that ever were; for the Devils do not tempt us but to what we our ſelves have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to, but theſe will have us by force, whether Love will or no. The Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> was in a great perplexity; for ſhe repoſed a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary confidence in the Prior of St. <hi>Martins,</hi> having beſtowed upon him the charge of the Abbeys of the <hi>Mountrevillyes,</hi> and ſome other places. But the Crime being ſo odious, did ſtrike ſuch a horror into her, and did give her ſuch a deſire to revenge the Innocence of the poor Virgin, that ſhe did communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it to the Chancellor of the King, (then Legat in <hi>France</hi>) and ſent for the Prior, who could make no other Excuſe, but that he was threeſcore and ten years of age; he Petitioned to the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:119929:128"/>that (if ſhe would ever vouchſafe any favour to him in recompence of all his ſervices) ſhe would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be a means that the Proceſſe ſhould proceed no further, and that he would acknowledge Siſter <hi>Mary Herouet</hi> to be the Pearl of Honour, and of Virginity. The Queen hearing him, was ſo amazed, that ſhe knew not what anſwer to return unto him, but left him on the place, &amp; the poor Man being confounded in himſelf, did retire into his Priory, where he would not permit any one to ſee him, and lived not above one year afterwards. And Siſter <hi>Mary Herouet</hi> being eſteemed as highly as ſhe did deſerve to be, for the great virtues with which God had indued her, was removed from the Abby of <hi>Gif,</hi> where ſhe indured ſo much tribulation, and made Abbeſſe (by the Gift of the King) of the fair Abbey called <hi>Gien,</hi> not far from <hi>Montargis,</hi> which place ſhe reformed, and lived full of the Spirit of God, praiſing him throughout the whole courſe of her life, that he at once had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon her both Reſt, and Honours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, Oſerve here a Hiſtory which may ſerve to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth of that which the Goſpel maketh mention of, and St.</hi> Paul <hi>to the</hi> Corinthians, <hi>That God by weak things doth confound the mighty, and by things contemptible to the eys of Men, he dazles the glory of thoſe who believed themſelves to be ſomething, and are indeed leſſe than nothing. And, believe it, Ladies, that without the Grace of God there is not any Man from whom we may expect the leaſt Goodneſs; nor is there ſo ſtrong a temptation, but by his Grace we may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, as you may perceive by the Confuſion of this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, who was accounted a juſt Man, &amp; by the exaltation of the other whom he would have made a ſinner. And in that is verified the ſaying of our Saviour, Who doth exalt himſelf ſhall be humbled, and who doth humble himſelf ſhall be exalted. Alas,</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>How much hath this Prior deceived the expectations of honeſt minds? for I find by him, that he relyed more on himſelf, than on God, and (what is much to be lamented) many are ſo
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:119929:128"/>miſguided, that they repoſe more confidence in their Prieſts than on any Authority either in Heaven or Earth. So will not I, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>for I deſire no more conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Prieſts, than what of neceſſity cannot be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. No doubt</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>but there are amongſt them many excellent Men; and therefore becauſe ſome of them are wicked, they muſt not all be judged; and you ſhall find, that thoſe who are the beſt of them, doe not frequent either the Houſes of Secular Men, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Women.

               <head>Three Murders committed in one Houſe, that is to ſay, of the Gentleman who was Maſter of it, of his Wife, and his Child, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the wickedneſſe of a Frier.</head>
               <head type="sub">The Third Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the County of <hi>Perigord</hi> there was a Gentleman who had ſuch a Devotion to St. <hi>Francis,</hi> that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him that all thoſe who did wear that habit ought to be like unto that good Saint. In the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of whom he had cauſed to be made in his houſe a Chamber on purpoſe, and a Wardrobe to entertain them, and after their counſel he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all his affairs, even almoſt to the Government of his menial Servants, conceiving with himſelf, that both he and they walked ſurely in treading in the paths of their counſels. It ſo fell out, that the Wife of this Gentleman, who was fair, and no leſſe wiſe than virtuous, was brought to Bed of a Son, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the love which her Husband did bear unto her was doubly augmented: And a Feaſt being prepared, the Brother-in-law was ſent for. The Hour of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being come, there arrived a Frier, whoſe Name I will conceal for the honour I bear unto Religion. The Gentleman was very glad to ſee his ſpiritual Father there, from whom he did conceal no ſecret. And after much diſcourſe betwixt his Brother-in-law, his Wife, and himſelf, they did ſit down to Supper; during which time the young Gentleman looking on his Wife, who had a great gracefulneſſe with her, and beauty enough to render her deſirable, did ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud unto the Frier, and propounded the Queſtion to him; Father, Is it true, that a Man ſins mortally to lye with his Wife during the moneth that ſhe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in? The Frier, who had a Countenance and a Tongue contrary to his heart, did make anſwer to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:119929:129"/>him, Sir, without all controverſy it is one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſins that can be committed in Marriage: And this may appear by the Example of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who would not come into the Temple until af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the day of her Purification, although ſhe had no need of being purified: As much ought you to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from a little pleaſure, ſeeing (to obey the Law) the bleſſed Virgin abſtained to enter into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where was all her Conſolation; Moreover, the Doctors of Phyſick do affirm, that there is great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Iſſue that may enſue thereby. When the Gentleman heard thoſe words, he was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, for he well hoped that his Confeſſor would have been ſo far indulgent to him, but giving ear unto his counſel, he did ſpeak no more unto him.</p>
               <p>The Confeſſor during this Diſcourſe (having drunk a little deeper than was expedient for him) and beheld the young Gentlewoman, he debated, and concluded with himſelf, that if he were her Husband he would not ask the advice of any one, whoſoever he were, when he ſhould lie with his own Wife. And, as the Fire, by little and little doth kindle, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe its flames, until at the laſt it doth ſet the whole houſe on fire; ſo this poor Frier did begin to burn in ſuch a Concupiſcence, that incontinently he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with himſelf to arrive to the end of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, which, for above three years together, he had carried covered, and glowing in his heart.</p>
               <p>After the Table-cloath was taken away, he took the Gentleman by the hand, and leading him near unto the Bed of his Wife, he ſaid unto him before her. Sir, Becauſe I am aſſured of the great love that is betwixt you and this young Lady your Wife, which (together with the heat and luſtineſſe of your youth) doth ſo much ſollicit you, I muſt confeſſe, I have great compaſſion of you, and therefore I will acquaint you with a ſecret of our Theology, which is, that the Law (how rigorous ſoever is be, by reaſon of the abuſe of indiſcreet Husbands) will not permit,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119929:130"/>that thoſe who are of a good Conſcience, as your ſelf, ſhould be fruſtrated of their honeſt Deſires: Wherefore, Sir, in the preſence of your People, I have laid down before you the Ordinance and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Law, but from you who are a virtuous Man, I will not conceal the ſweetneſſe of it; For know (my Son) as there are Women and Women, ſo there are Men and Men. In the firſt place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt demand of the young Lady your Wife, that ſeeing there are but three weeks ſince ſhe was brought to bed, If her flux of blood be yet ceaſed? to which the young Lady made anſwer, That for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it was, and that ſhe was clean: Why then, ſaid the Frier, My Son, I give you leave to lie with her, without any ſcruple; but you muſt firſt promiſe me two things, which the Gentleman did moſt willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſent unto: The Firſt is, (ſaid the Confeſſor) That you muſt not ſpeak the leaſt word, but come with all privacie unto her: the other is, That you approach not to her untill two hours after Midnight, that the Digeſtion of the young Lady be not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by your Familiarities. The Gentleman did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to obſerve this, and did ſwear unto it ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he who knew him to be a greater Fool than a Lyar, was aſſured in himſelf that he would keep his word. After much variety of Diſcourſe, the Frier retired himſelf into his Chamber, bidding them both Good-night, and giving them a great Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman withdrawing himſelf, his Wife took him by the hand, and ſaid unto him, Without doubt then you will come, and will not make your poor Wife to wake any longer. The Gentleman kiſſing her, ſaid unto her, Sweet-heart, Leave your door open, which words the Frier heard very well, and ſo they all retired into their own chambers. The Frier, as ſoon as he was come into his, did take no thought either for ſleep or reſt, but as ſoon as ever he heard all things quiet in the houſe (it being
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119929:130"/>much about the hour in which he was accuſtomed to go to Mattens,) repaired directly and ſoftly to the Chamber, where the Gentleman was expected, and having found the door half open, he finely and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly did put out the Candle, and lay as cloſe unto his Wife as poſſibly he could, without ſpeaking any word. The young Lady, thinking it was her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, did ſay unto him, Sweet-heart, you have kept your promiſe but ill which laſt night you made unto our Confeſſor, which was, that you would not come unto me till two of the clock. But the Frier being more intentive to the life that was active, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative, and withall being afraid that he ſhould be diſcovered, did think more to ſatisfie his deſires, which for a long time had impoyſoned his heart, than to make any anſwer to her. The young Lady was much aſtonied at it, and the Frier finding the hour to approach in which her Husband was to come, he did riſe from the young Lady, and returned ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his own Chamber; and as the Fury of his Concupiſcence had before taken away all ſleep from him, ſo now the guilt of his Fear, which always fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth wickedneſſe, would not permit him to take any Reſt, but he directed his Courſe to the Porter of the Houſe, and ſaid unto him, Friend, <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enſieur</hi> your Maſter hath commanded me to go immediatly to our Covent to make ſome prayers, it being now the ſecond hour of Devotion; wherefore, I pray you, give me my Packet of Papers, and open the Door, but do it ſo ſoftly that no body may hear it; for my buſineſſe is neceſſary and ſecret. The Porter know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well, that to obey the Frier was a ſervice ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry agreeable to his Maſter, did open the Door very ſoftly for him, and did let him forth.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman at that inſtant did awake, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the hour did approach which was admitted to him by his Confeſſor to give a viſit to his Wife, he did ariſe from his bed, and having put on his Night-Gown, he made haſt thither, whither he
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:119929:131"/>lawfully might come by the Ordinance of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any permiſſion of Man. When his Wife did hear him ſpeak unto her, (being ignorant of her miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) ſhe was poſſeſſed with ſuch an amazement, that ſhe ſaid unto him, Is this your promiſe, Sir, which you have made to the Confeſſor, to have ſuch a care both of your Soul and mine? was it not enough to come to me once before your hour, but do you now return again? The Gentleman was ſo troubled to hear this Interrogatory, that he could not diſſemble his affliction, but ſaid unto her, What mean theſe words which you ſpeak unto me? I know for a truth that theſe three weeks I have not lain with you, and do you reprove me for comming ſo often to you? If you continue in this diſcourſe you will make me to believe that my Company is hatefull to you, and (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my cuſtom, and deſire) you will conſtrain me to look for that pleaſure from others, which by the Law of God I am to receive from you. The young Lady, who thought that he had mocked her, ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Sir, I beſeech you, that in imagining me to be a deceiver, you do not deceive your ſelf; for though you did not ſpeak unto me, about an hour ago, when you were with me, yet I am ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelf, that it was you. The Gentleman imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly underſtood, that they were both deceived, and added Oaths to his Proteſtations, that he did not come unto her: whereupon the Lady took ſo great a grief, that with tears ſhe beſought him to make a diligent ſcrutiny to find who it was, for none, that night, lay in her houſe, but her Brother and the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Gentleman being ſurpriſed with a Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that it was the Frier, did in all haſt repair unto the Chamber where he lay, and found him not there. And the better to be aſſured what was become of him, in an angry and a trembling ſpeed, he did go unto the Porter, and demanded of him if he knew what was become of him? who (according to what the Frier told him) did give him a full Relation of the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:119929:131"/>Truth. The Gentleman being fully aſſured that it was he who did commit this wickedneſſe, did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return to the Chamber of his Wiſe, and ſaid unto her, Without all doubt, Sweet-heart, the Man who lay with you, and did ring ſo well his Mattens Bell, was our Father the Confeſſor. The young Lady, who all her life had loved her Honour as her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, did enter into ſuch a Deſpair, that forgetting all humanity, and the nature of a woman, ſhe did on her knees beſeech him to revenge that great Injury. Wherefore on a ſudden, without any delay, the Gentleman took horſe, and purſued the Frier.</p>
               <p>The poor young Lady being alone in her Bed, and as much without counſel as without comfort, ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her little Infant but newly born, conſidered with her ſelf the marvellous and horrible miſchance that had befalln her, and without excuſing her own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, did repute her ſelf the moſt guilty, and the moſt unfortunate Woman in the world, and found her ſelf ſo overcome in this aſſault of her Deſpair, grounded on the enormity and greatneſſe of her ſin, and the love of her Husband to her, and on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of both their Families, that ſhe eſteemed Death far more happy than Life, and was ſuddenly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſo violent a Melancholy, that ſhe fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Deſpair, that ſhe not only loſt that hope which every Chriſtian ought to have in God, but was quite eſtranged from common ſenſe, and forgat her own Nature. Inſomuch, that being as far from all knowledge of God, as from all knowledge of her ſelf, as a Woman quite bereft of ſenſe and reaſon, ſhe took the cord of her Bed; and with her own hands ſtrangled her ſelf, and which is worſe, being in the agony of this cruel Death, her body, which combated againſt it, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it ſelf in ſuch a ſort, that with her foot ſhe ſtruck againſt the poor Infant, whoſe Innocence could not preſerve it, from following by her own Death her moſt afflicted and dolorous Mother: But
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:119929:132"/>dying ſhe made ſo great a noiſe, that one of her Maids in the next Chamber being amazed at it, did riſe in great haſt to light the Candle, and on her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn having beheld her Miſtreſſe hanging, and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the cord of the bed, and her Infant dead, and lying at her feet, ſhe afrighted did run into the Chamber where her Miſtreſſes Brother did lye, whom ſhe took along with her to behold this lamentable ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>The Brother crying out Woe, and Alas, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo great a lamentation as ſuch a Brother ought to do who loved his Siſter with all his heart, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Chambermaid, Who it was that had committed ſo great a villany? She made anſwer, that ſhe knew not who, and that none but her Maſter came into the Chamber, who was not long ſince gone out of it. The Brother entring into the Chamber of the Gentleman, and finding him not there, did aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly believe that it was he who was guilty of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Murder, and taking his horſe, without deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any further, did gallop after him, and met him in the way returning from the purſute of the Frier, being ſad that he could not overtake him. When ever his Brother-in-law did behold him, he did cry out unto him, Wicked and Wretched as thou art, defend thy ſelf, for this day I doubt not but with this ſword God will revenge me. The Gentleman, who would have excuſed himſelf, did ſee the ſword of his Brother-in-law ſo near unto his throat, that he found he had more need to defend himſelf, than to make any pauſe to demand the Cauſe of the Debate, and drawing upon him, they gave one another ſo many cuts and ſlaſhes, that the effuſion of their blood, and their wearineſſe together, did conſtrain them to ſit down upon the Ground, both on the one ſide and on the other, to take breath: The Gentleman ſaid unto him, What occaſion is it (my Brother) that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the great love that hath been always between us, into ſo cruel a Fight? The Brother-in-law made
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:119929:132"/>anſwer to him, What was the occaſion that moved you to put my poor Siſter, who was one of the moſt virtuous women that ever lived, to ſo ignominious a death, and ſo barbarouſly to act your Murder, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the prerence of lying with her, to ſtrangle her with the Cord of the Bed. The Gentleman un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding theſe words, being more dead than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, did ſay unto him, Is it poſſible? Have you ſeen your Siſter in that Eſtate as you inform me? When the other Brother did aſſure him of it, he proceeded and ſaid, But what was the Reaſon that did cauſe you to forſake your Houſe? Whereupon he told him what the wicked Frier had done, at which his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was much amazed, and being ſorry at the heart that againſt all reaſon he had aſſaulted him, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded pardon of him. The Gentleman replyed unto him, Although you have done the Injury, it is I who have the puniſhment, for I am ſo ſorely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that I believe I ſhall not eſcape with life. His Brother-in-law did endeavour the beſt that poſſibly he could to help him upon his Horſe, which being done, he did bring him gently to his houſe, where the next morning he died. His Brother-in-law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed before all his Friends and Kinſmen, that he was the only occaſion of his Death. And to ſatisfie Juſtice, he was counſelled to addreſſe himſelf to King. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that Name, to demand pardon of him. Wherefore, having honourably interred the Husband, Wife, and Infant, he repaired on Good Friday to the Court, to purchaſe his Remiſſion, and obtained it, by the ſollicitation of Mr. <hi>Francis Oliver,</hi> who was then Chancellor of <hi>Alençon,</hi> and ſince for his great Virtues, choſen by the King to be Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of <hi>France.</hi>

If all the world were as ſevere as you</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>the poor Prieſts would be worſe than Excommunicated, being to be deprived of the ſight of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

               <p>IN the Court of the King and Queen of <hi>Caſtile</hi> (whoſe Names ſhall not be expreſſed) there was a Gentleman, ſo exquiſit in his Complexion, and proportion of Body, and the ſweetneſſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that in all <hi>Spain</hi> there was not an Equal to him. Every one had his Virtues in admiration, but admired more the ſtrange Conditions of him, for it was never known that he loved or ſerved any La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and although there were in the Court ſo great and ſo fair a number of them, that they were able to melt the very Ice it ſelf, yet not any of them had the power to captivat the heart of this Gentleman, whoſe Name was <hi>Eliſor.</hi> The Queen, who was a Lady of great Virtue, but not altogether exempt from the Flame, which, the leſſe it is known, the more it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, obſerving this Gentleman who courted not any one of all the Ladies in her Court, did much wonder at him, and one day demanded of him, If it were poſſible that he did love ſo little as he did make the world to believe. He made anſwer to her, that if ſhe could ſee his Heart as well as his Countenance, ſhe would not propound that queſtion to him. She deſiring to know what it was that he would confeſſe, did preſſe him ſo much, that he acknowledged to her, that he did indeed love a Lady, and the moſt virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one in all Chriſtendom. She uſed all her power by Intreaties and Commands to underſtand who it was, but ſhe could not learn it of him. Whereupon, ſeeming to be angry with him, ſhe did ſwear, That ſhe would never ſpeak vnto him more, if he would not give her the Name of that Lady whom ſo much he loved; at which he was ſo much perplexed that he was conſtrained to profeſſe unto her, That he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

He was mounted on a black Horſe, richly trapped with all the gallant furniture that belonged to a Horſe. The trappings were all covered with Gold, and with a Morresk work ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell'd with black. His Cloak was of black Silk, on the ſhoulder thereof was a badge moſt curiouſly wrought, and adorned with precious ſtones, where he had for a Deviſe Love covered by force; His ſword and his poynado were no leſſe beautifull, and ſet forth with as rich devices. To be ſhort, he was compleat cap a pei'd, and moſt remarkable when he was on horsback, and knew ſo well to manage his Horſe, that all thoſe who did obſerve him, neglected the recreation of hunting, to obſerve the Courſes and Corvettoes which he made. Having in thoſe Courſes brought the Queen unto the place where the Nets were pitched, he alighted from his Horſe, and came to aſſiſt the Queen as ſhe was alighting, who ſtretching forth her arms unto him, he opened his Coat, and taking her in his arms, did ſhew her his Corſlet where the Mirror was, and ſaid unto her, Madam, I beſeech you to behold your ſelf in it, and without attending any anſwer, he did ſet her ſoftly
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:119929:134"/>on the Ground. The Hunting being ended, the Queen returned to the Caſtle, without ſpeaking one word to <hi>Eliſor,</hi> but after Supper ſhe ſent for him, and told him, That he was the greateſt Lyar that ſhe ever knew, for he had promiſed her faithfully to ſhew that Lady in the Chace unto her whom he moſt loved, which he had not performed, wherefore ſhe reſolved with her ſelf not to eſteem him any more. <hi>Eliſor</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the Queen had not underſtood what he had ſaid unto her, did make anſwer, That he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed what he promiſed; for he had not only ſhewed her the woman, but that part of her which he loved beſt. The Queen pretending not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him, did reply unto him, That ſhe did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he had ſhewed any one of her Ladies to her. It is true, ſaid <hi>Eliſor,</hi> But what did I ſhow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, as you were alighting from your Horſe? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſaid the Queen, but only a fair Glaſs upon your Breſt: And what did you behold in that Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſaid <hi>Eliſor?</hi> I ſaw nothing but my own face, ſaid the Qu. <hi>Eliſor</hi> ſaid unto her, then Madam, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to your Commandment, I have fulfilled my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, for there ſhall be never any other repreſentation in my heart, but that which you ſaw upon my Breſt, &amp; it is that only whom I love &amp; reverence, &amp; adore, not as a Woman, but as a Goddeſſe upon Earth, into whoſe hands I do put both my Life and Death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching you, that my moſt entire and abſolute affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (which was all my Life, as long as I concealed it) may not prove my Death by my diſcovering it: And if I am not worthy to be regarded, and accepted as your Servant, at leaſt permit, that I may live (as I have been accuſtomed to do) upon the Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have to behold you, my heart having been ſo bold to chuſe ſo high, ſo perfect, and ſo Majeſtick a place for the foundation of its love, of which I can have no other ſatisfaction, but to know, that my love is ſo great and abſolute, that I am contented only to love although I am not be beloved again; And if it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:119929:135"/>doth not pleaſe you by the knowledge of my great love to have me more agreeable to you, and to affect me more than heretofore, at the leaſt take not my life from me, which conſiſteth in the happineſſe I have to ſee you, as I have been accuſtomed to do. If you pleaſe to look upon me with more rigor, you will have one ſervant leſſe, and loſe the moſt affectionate one which you ever had, or ever can have.</p>
               <p>The Qu. whether to ſhew her ſelf what ſhe was not, or elſe all along to make more trial of the love which he did bear unto her, or whether ſhe loved ſome other Servant, whom ſhe would not leave for him, or elſe to reſerve him untill he whom ſhe had loved had done ſome fault, and then, afterwards to receive him into his place, did ſpeak unto him with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance neither angry, nor yet contented, <hi>Eliſor,</hi> Being ignorant of the authority of Love, I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of you what folly did betray you into ſo great, ſo high, and ſo dangerous a humor, as to be in love with me; for I know that the heart of Man is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at Mans Commandement, that he cannot make it either to hate or to love, as he himſelf would. But becauſe you have ſo well declared your mind, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know how long it is ſince you firſt did begin to love me. <hi>Eliſor</hi> obſerving her to ſmile upon him, and that ſhe inquired after his Malady, did well hope that ſhe would vouchſafe ſome remedy unto him, but beholding on a ſudden her countenance to change a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he was ſtruck with a fear, thinking himſelf to be before a ſevere Judge, who was ready to pronounce ſentence upon him. Howſoever, he took the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to aſſure her, that his love had taken a deep root in his heart ever ſince his childhood, but it did not burn within him to make him feel the pain thereof, but the laſt ſeven years, and he ſaid he could not properly call it a pain, but rather a Malady, which gave ſuch a contentment, that the recovery from it was Death. Since it is ſo, ſaid the Queen, that you have laboured in ſo great a trial, I ought to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:119929:135"/>be no more light to believe it, than you have been to expreſſe it; wherefore, if it be as you ſay, I will make ſuch a proof of it, that afterwards I ſhall have no reaſon to doubt it, and this proof being made, I ſhall eſteem you to be ſuch unto me, as you your ſelf do ſwear you are, and I knowing you to be ſuch, as you ſay, you ſhall find me to be ſuch, as you deſire. <hi>Eliſor</hi> beſought her to make what proof of him ſhe pleaſed, for there was nothing ſo difficult that ſhould not be very eaſie to him, to obtain that great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that ſhe might know, and be aſſured of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which he did bear unto her, and beſought her to command him that which ſhe would have don. She ſaid unto him, <hi>Eliſor,</hi> If you do love me as much as you affirm, I am aſſured that to enjoy my favour nothing can be too hard for you. Wherefore I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, by all your deſires to have it, and your fears to loſe it, that without ſeeing me any more, you do depart the Court to morrow, and retire into ſome place where you may not hear from me, nor I have any tidings of you, for ſeven following years. You who have already paſſed ſeven years in this love, do know in your ſelf that you love me. When I have had the like expecience of it for ſeven other years, I ſhall know and believe that, which your words cannot make me to underſtand, much leſſe to believe. <hi>Eliſor</hi> hearing this cruell Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, doubted on the one ſide, that if he ſhould ſtay, ſhe would remove him from her preſence; and on the other ſide, hoping that the Event would ſpeak better for him than her words, he did accept the Command, and ſaid unto her, Since I have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſeven years without any hope at all, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed this fire, now it is known unto you, I ſhall bear and paſſe away theſe ſeven years to come with more patience. But Madam, in obeying your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, by which I am deprived of all the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I have in the world, what hope will you give me at the end of ſeven years, when you have found
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:119929:136"/>me to be your faithful and your loyal Servant? The Queen taking a ring from off her finger, did ſay unto him, Behold this Ring which I do give you, Break it in the middle, and you ſhall keep one half thereof, and I the other; to the end, that if the length of time ſhall take away from my memory the knowledg of your face, I may know it by that half part of the Ring which you ſhall keep. <hi>Eliſor</hi> did take the Ring and did break it in two pieces, and gave one part thereof to the Queen, and kept the other him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and taking his leave of her, more dead than thoſe who have render'd up their ſouls, he departed to his Lodgings, to take order for his journey, which he performed in ſuch a manner, that he ſent all his train from the Court to his own Houſe, and did tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel himſelf attended but with one ſervant, into a place ſo ſolitary, that not any of his Kinred or his Friends for the ſpace of ſeven long years, did know where he was, or heard the leaſt tidings of him. The life he did lead during that time, and the afflictions he endured by reaſon of his abſence, cannot be known; howſoever thoſe that perfectly do ſove, cannot but in ſome meaſure be acquainted with them.</p>
               <p>At the full end of ſeven years, juſt as the Queen was going to hear Maſſe, a Hermit with a great beard came unto her, who kiſſing her hand, did preſent her with a Petition, which on the ſudden ſhe did not take the pains to look on, although ſhe was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with her own hands to take all the Petitions that were preſented to her, how poor ſoever they were that did preſent them. When the Maſſe was half ſaid, ſhe opened the Petition, and in the fuſt place found incloſed in it, that part of the Ring which ſhe had given unto <hi>Eliſor,</hi> whereat ſhe was tranſported with as much Joy as Amazement, and having read what was contained in the Petition, ſhe ſuddenly commanded her Almoner to bring the Hermit to her who had preſented that Petition. The Almoner did
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:119929:136"/>ſeek him every where, but he could hear no tidings of him, but only that he was ſeen to take horſe, but which way he did go it was impoſſible to be known.</p>
               <p>The Queen did read the Petition over, and over, attending the anſwer of her Almoner, and found alſo a Letter incloſed in it moſt excellently penned, the ſubſtance whereof was to ſhew the ſtrange effects which time had produced, in renewing and reſining the affections, and changing a Love Temporal into a Love Spiritual, and Eternal.</p>
               <p>This Epiſtle was not read without many tears, and a great amazement, accompanyed with a grief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable: For ſhe thought that the loſſe ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in a ſervant full of ſo perfect love, ought to be eſteemed ſo great, that neither all her Exchequer, nor the Kingdom it ſelf, could take from her the title of being the moſt poor and moſt miſerable Lady in the world, becauſe ſhe had loſt that which no treaſure could redeem; And having heard Maſſe, ſhe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto her Chamber, and by her ſelf alone, did make ſo great a lamentation as her Cruelty did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. And there was neither Mountain, Rock, or Forteſt whither ſhe did not ſend, to find out this Hermit; but he who had taken him from her hands, did preſerve him from falling into them again, and did receive him into Paradiſe, ſo that in this world ſhe could hear no more tidings of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this Example no Servant ought to confeſſe that which can do him no good, and may aſſuredly hurt him: And much leſſe (Ladies) ought you, by reaſon of your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, to demand a proof ſo diſſicult, that in having it you may loſe the life of your Servant.

La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>are now a great deal more wiſe than heretofore they were, for in ſeven dayes proof they have now as much aſſurance of a Servant, as they had hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſeven years; And yet there are ſome in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longaren) <hi>who ſeven years together have been courted, and have endured all the proofs of the Harqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They ought then</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Simontault) <hi>to be number'd in the rank of the ſormer times, for in theſe dayes they are not to be received. Howſoever it was</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>the Gentleman was much obliged to the Lady, by whoſe means he was reclamed from the vanity of Terreſtrial love, and wholly devoted his heart to God. He met with an extraordinary happineſſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>to ſind God on the Highways; for ſeeing the affliction he had on him, I do much wonder that he did not give himſelf to the Devil.

If you are of that opinion</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament <hi>to</hi> Saffredant) <hi>if I were as you, I would never have any thing to do with any Woman.

I ſee very well</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>that the more we examine and debate upon this Subject, the more thoſe who will have all things go on their ſide, will take occaſion to speak the worſt of us that poſſibly they can, wherefore</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>I requeſt you to give your voice to ſome one. I do give it (ſaid he) to</hi> Longaren, <hi>being aſſured that ſhe will acquaint us with ſome grateful novelty, and will not, to speak the Truth, forbear either Man or woman. Since you do eſteem me to be ſo impartial</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren) <hi>I will aſſume the hardineſſe to acquaint you with the Fortune which happened to a very great Prince, who in virtue ſurpaſſed all others of his time. Underſtand withall, that the thing which we ought leaſt to uſe, but in the caſe only of extreme Neceſſity, is Diſſimulation: It is a Vice both vile and infamous, especially amongſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencates and Princes, in the mouths and countenances of whom Truth is far more becomming, than in any other perſon. But there is no Frince ſo great, although he hath all the honours and the riches that he can deſire, who is not ſubject unto the Empire, and the Tyranny of Love; inſomuch, that the more noble the Prince is, and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spirit, the more Love delighteth to make him to ſtoop under his powerful hand, for that wanton and glorious little God doth take no care of ſmall or common things, and his Majeſty doth make it his exerciſe every day to do wonders, as to make weak the ſtrong, and to make ſtrong the weak, to give underſtanding to the ignorant, and to take it away from the wiſe, to ſavour paſſions, and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:119929:138"/>to deſtroy reaſon, and all his delight is in ſuch changes. And becauſe Princes are not exempt from love, no more are they from the extremity into which the ſervitude of Love doth throw them. And therfore by force they may be permitted to uſe Diſſimulation, hypocrifie, and fiction, which are the means to overcome their Enemies, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of Maſter</hi> Iohn de-Moon. <hi>And ſince in ſuch an act the Condition of a Prince is pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which in no other act is to be allowed, becauſe it layes them open to Diſrepute, I will in this place give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto you of the Inventions of a young Prince, by which he deceived thoſe who are accuſtomed to deceive all the world.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The Fifth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Paris</hi> there was an Advocate more eſteemed than nine Men of his profeſſion, and by reaſon of his great ſufficiency being ſought after by all, he was the richeſt man of all thoſe of his Robe: who finding that he had no children by his firſt Wife, did hope to have iſſue by his ſecond; And although his Body was old and dryed up, yet his heart and his hope were not dead; wherefore he did chooſe to wife a young Geutlewoman of the City, of about eighteen or nineteen years of Age, very fair, and of a delicat complexion, whom he loved and tendred as much as poſſibly he could, but ſhe had no more Children by him, than he had by the former, which at the laſt did much trouble her. Wherefore her youth, which was not ſuitable to Melancholy, did cauſe her to ſeek out recreations in other places than in her own houſe, and ſhe repaired oftentimes to Feaſts and Dancings,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:119929:138"/>but ſhe always deported her ſelf ſo civilly, that her Husband could not entertain any bad opinion of her. For ſhe was alwayes in the company of thoſe in whom he had great confidence. Being one day invited to a Marriage, there was preſent a great Prince, who in reherſing the account, did for bid me to uſe his name. But I may well ſay unto you, that he was ſo brave a Prince, and of ſuch a Grace, that the like was never ſeen before in <hi>France,</hi> nor ever (I do believe) will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him be ſeen again. This Prince beholding this young Gentlewoman, whoſe eys and whoſe Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance did incite him to affect her, did come unto her, and did court her with ſuch fine language, that ſhe her ſelf was much taken with him and it, and did not conceal from him, that for a long time ſhe had that love in her heart, for which he did intreat her, and that he ſhould not take pains to perſwade her to that, to which at the firſt ſight Love had made her to conſent. The young Prince, by the courage of Love, having obtained that happineſſe, the purchaſe whereof did well deſerve a longer time, he thanked the blind little God, who ſo much favoured him. And after that hour he ſo well followed his affair, that they did both agree upon the means, how they might come together, without the obſervation of any.</p>
               <p>The place and time being agreed upon, the young Prince did not fail to come, and to preſerve the honour of the Gentlewoman, he did come diſguized, but by reaſon of the diſſolute boyes, who did run up and down the ſtreets in the night, by whom he would not be known, he took ſome Gentlemen with him to attend him. And in the entrance into the ſtreet where ſhe lived, he did diſmiſſe them, ſaying to them, If you hear no noiſe at all within this quarter of an hour, you may retire into your own lodgings, and about three or four hours hence fail not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect me in this place again. This they did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and hearing not any noiſe they withdrew
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:119929:139"/>themſelves into their own Chambers. The young Prince did directly take his Courſe to the Houſe of his Advocate, and found the Door open as it was promiſed him. But going up the ſtairs he did meet with her Husband, by reaſon whereof he was more ſeen than he deſired; Nevertheleſſe Love, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth underſtanding and boldneſſe in the greateſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, did ſo diſpoſe it, that the young Prince came directly to him, and ſaid, Monſieur the Advocate, You know the confidence which I and all thoſe of my Houſe do repoſe in you, and that I do eſteem you to be one of the beſt, and moſt faithfull Servants that I have, I was willing to come privatly to you to viſit you, as well to recommend my affairs unto you, as to deſire a Cup of your wine, for I ſtand in need of it, and not to acquaint any whomſoever that I am here, for from this place I muſt immediatly go into an other, where I would not be known.</p>
               <p>The good Man the Advocate was ſo glad of tho Honour which the Prince had done him to come ſo privatly unto his houſe, that he brought him to his Chamber, and gave a charge to his Wife with all ſpeed to make ready a Collation of the beſt fruits and Confects that ſhe had. This moſt willingly ſhe did, and brought him the beſt banquet that in ſo ſhort a time ſhe poſſibly could provide. And although her Night habit in which ſhe was dreſt did render her moſt lovely and deſirable, yet the young Prince did make a ſemblance before her Husband nor to regard her at all, but did ſpeak to him altogether concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his affairs, as having alwayes managed them for him. And as the Gentlewoman on her knees did hold the Confects to the Prince, and her Husband did go to the Cupbord to fetch him ſome Wine, ſhe whiſpered to him, that at his going our of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he ſhould not fail to go into the Wardrobe on the right hand, where, as ſoon as poſſibly ſhe could, ſhe would come to him. When ever he had drank
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:119929:139"/>he roſe up, and thanked the Advocate, who was very importunate with him to attend him to the door of his Houſe; but he would not give way unto it, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that whither he was going, he had no need of his Company: and turning to the Advocates Wife, he ſaid unto her, Neither will I do you ſo much wrong as to take away your good Husband from you, who is one of my moſt antient ſervants; you are ſo happy in him, that you have occaſion to thank God for him, and to ſerve him, and obey him, and if you ſhall do otherwiſe, you will be too blame.</p>
               <p>The young Prince ſpeaking theſe words did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and ſhutting the door after him, that he might not be followed to the ſtairs, did enter into the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe, where, after her Husband was aſleep, the fair Wife came, and did lead him into a Cabinet the beſt accommodated that poſſibly could be, although the two beſt pictures (whatſoever habiliments they had on them) were her and himſelf there. I make no doubt but ſhe performed all the promiſes which ſhe had made unto him, from whence, about the hour in which his Gentlemen were commanded to attend him, he retired, and found them waiting for him in the ſame place, accordingly as he had enjoyned them. And becauſe this life continued a long time, the young Prince did find out a neerer way to goe unto her, which was to paſſe through a Monaſtery, having prevailed with the Prior that every night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight, the Porter ſhould open the door unto him, and likewiſe when he returned; And becauſe the Houſe whither he did go was contiguous to the Monaſtery, he took not any with him to attend him. And although he did lead this life as I have told you, yet this Prince (for all that) did fear and love God; and though he never made any ſtay when he did go through the Monaſtery, yet on his return he never failed to continue in the Church a long time in the exerciſe of prayers, which gave a great occaſion to the religious Men, (who going in,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:119929:140"/>and comming forth from their Mattens, did ſee him alwayes upon his knees) to eſteem him to be the moſt holy Young man in the world. This Prince had a Siſter who did much frequent this Religious place, and loving her Brother more than all the creatures in the world, did commend him to the prayers of all the religious perſonages ſhe did know: And one day moſt affectionately commending him to the Prior of the ſaid Monaſtery, he ſaid unto her, Alas Madam! what is that which you command me? you talk to me of your Brother, as of a man of the world, in whoſe prayers I have more need to have my ſelf recommended; for if he be not holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and ſure to go to heaven, (repeating that place of Scripture, that <hi>Happy is he who can do evil, and will not</hi>) I have no hope to be there at all. His Siſter, who had a labouring deſire to underſtand what knowledge this Prior had of the goodnes of her Brother, did preſs upon him with ſuch importunities, that under the veil of Confeſſion he acknowledged the Secret, &amp; moreover ſaid her, Is it not indeed wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to behold ſo lovely, &amp; ſo yong a Prince to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his pleaſures and his reſt, to come ſo conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear our Mattens; for, not as a Prince ſeeking the honour of this world, but as one ſincerely Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, he comes every morning one hour after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night by himſelf into one of our Chapels. Without all queſtion that piety of his doth render my ſelf and my Brethren ſo confounded, that in compariſon of him, we ought not to be eſteemed by any, nor indeed are worthy to be called Religious. His Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who underſtood theſe words, could not but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; for, notwithſtanding that her Brother had no relation to Orders Eccleſiaſtical, yet ſhe knew that he had a good Conſcience, and a great faith and love in God, but that he did repair to the Church ſo conſtantly, and in ſuch an hour, ſhe had not the leaſt imagination of it. Wherefore ſhe came unto him, and telling him of the good opinion that
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:119929:140"/>the religious Men had of him, he could not forbear from laughing outright, and with ſuch a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that ſhe who knew him as well as her own heart, did know that there was ſome myſtery in that Devotion, and did never leave him, till he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the truth unto her; which is ſuch as I have here put down in writing, and which he did me the honour to account unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this, Ladies, you may know, that neither the craſt of the Lawyer, nor the cunning of the Divine, can privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege them, but Love (in the caſe of Neceſſity) can deceive them; and ſince Love can deceive the deceivers, we poor ignorant creatures ought well to ſtand in fear of it. And me-thinks</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>if I may ſpeak what I think, that he is to be commended in that thing: for we find but ſew of thoſe great perſonages, who have any care at all to ſave the benour of women, or to deſend them or themſelves from publick ſoandal; nay, oftentimes they are the cauſe that we think worſe of Ladies, than indeed there is reaſon for. Truly</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>I could wiſh that all young Lords and Princes would take example by him, for oftentimes the ſcandal is more than the ſin. Do you think</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>that the prayers which he made in the Monaſtery thorough which he paſſed, were well grounded? You ought not to be a Judge</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament) <hi>for it may be that on his Return, his Repentance was ſuch that his ſin was forgiven him. It is a hard task</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>to repent of ſo pleaſant a ſin. As for my ſelf, I have often confeſſed, but repented but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. It were better</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>not to confeſs at all, unleſs you had a true repentance.

               <p>IN the reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, there was a young Signior called Monſieur <hi>D' Avanes,</hi> the Son of Monſieur <hi>Alebret,</hi> brother to King <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> with whom the ſaid Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> had his ordinary reſidence. This young Signior was about fifteen years of age, ſo lovely and graceful, that it ſeems he was not made, but to be loved and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, which he was by all thoſe whoever ſaw him, and above all by a Gentlewoman living in the City of <hi>Pampelone</hi> in <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was married there to a very rich man, with whom ſhe lived in a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:119929:141"/>good and a great repute; and although ſhe was not above three and twenty years of age, yet becauſe her Husband was above fifty, ſhe did attire her ſelf ſo modeſtly, that ſhe ſeemed by her dreſſe to be rather a Widdow than a young married Woman; and never did any one ſee her go to Wedding or Feaſt without her Husband, whoſe virtue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhe did ſo much eſteem, that ſhe preferred it to the youth and lovelineſſe of all others. Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band finding her ſo diſcreet, had ſuch a confidence in her, that he committed to her care and charge all the affairs of his houſe. One day this rich man with his Wife was invited to the marriage of one of his kinted: in which (the more to honour the Nuptials) there was the young Signior of <hi>Avanes</hi> who naturally loved dancings, in which exerciſe of delight there was none that could ſurpaſſe him. After dinner, when the Mask began, the rich man deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> to dancent the Signior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him what Lady he ſhould lead; who made anſwer to him, Sir, if there were any here more lovely, or more at my commandment than my own wife, I would preſent her to you, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you that you would do me the honour as to lead my Wife in the dance, which the young Prince did; but his youth at that time was ſo unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that he took more pleaſure to vault and cut capers, than to regard the beauty of the Ladies: And on the contrary, ſhe whom he did lead, did more reguard the beauty and gracefulneſſe of the ſaid Signior, than the dance in which ſhe was, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her diſcretion was ſuch, that ſhe made not the leaſt appearance of it. The hour of Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> did bid adieu to the company, and returned to the Caſtle, to which place the rich man did accompany him being moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on his Mule; and in the way he ſaid unto him, Sir, you have this day done ſo great an honour to my ſelf and to my kinred, that in me it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:119929:142"/>if with all my fortunes I ſhould not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my ſelf to do you ſervice: Sir, I know very well that ſuch young Lords as you, who hard and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Fathers, have oftentimes more need of money than we, who keeping but a poor train, and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary houſe, do think more of the heaping of it up, than which way to lay it forth; Sir, ſo is is, that God having given me a Wife according to my own deſire, hath not only in this World given me my Paradiſe, being fruſtrated of thoſe hopes and joys which Parents have of their Children. Sir I know that it is too much honour to me to adopt you as my child, but if you pleaſe to receive me for a Servant, and declare unto me what your occaſions are, I will not fail to be ayding to you in your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, as far as one hundred thouſand Crowns will ſtretch; Monſieur <hi>Avanes</hi> was very joyful of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, for he had ſuch a Father as the rich man had character'd; and having heartlly thanked him, he called him Father by alliance.</p>
               <p>From the ſame hour the rich man did take ſuch affection to Signior <hi>D' Avanes,</hi> that Evening and Morning he did not fail to ſend unto him to hnow if he ſtood in need of any thing; And he concealed not from his Wife the Devotion he had to Signior <hi>D' Avanes,</hi> which made her doubly to love him, and after that hour the Signior had of him whatſoever he deſired: He oftentimes would repair to the rich mans houſe to eat and drink with him, and when he was not at home his Wiſe would give unto him whatſoever with reaſon he deſired, and moreover would ſpeak ſo diſcreetly to him, admoniſhing him to be virtuous, that he ſtood in fear of her, and did love her more than all the Women in the World.</p>
               <p>She who had God and her Honour before her eyes, was contented with his ſight, and to heat him ſpeak unto her, in which conſiſts the ſatisfaction of honeſty and true love, inſomuch that ſhe never gave him any ſign whereby he might conceive or judge,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:119929:142"/>that ſhe did bear any other affection to him, but what was pious and fraternal. During this covered Love, Monſieur <hi>D' Avanes,</hi> having received the large ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies above-ſpoken, was very gorgeous in his cloaths, and maintained a gallant Equipage; and being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen years of Age, he began to court La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and to ſeek after them more than he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to do: And although he had rather make love to this wiſe young Gentlewoman, than to any other, yet the fear he had to loſe her love, if ſhe ſhould underſtand his Intents, did cauſe him to hold his peace, and to think where to place his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions ſomewhere elfe.</p>
               <p>In this reſolution he did addreſs himſelf to a young Lady not far from <hi>Pampelone,</hi> who had a houſe alſo in that City, and was newly married to a young man, who above all things did love horſes, and doggs, and hawks. For the love of her Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to make a thouſand paſtimes, as Turnaments, Horſe-races, Masks, Feaſts, and other ſports, at all which this young Lady would be alwayes preſent. But becauſe her Husband was very phantaſtical, her Father and Mother, being jealous of her honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew her to be beautiful, and of a frolick diſpoſition, did keep her ſo cloſe, that Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> could have nothing of her, but now and then ſome few words when they danced together; although in a ſmall time he did eaſily perceive that to the compleating of their loves there was nothing wanting but Time and place: Wherefore he came to his good Father the rich Man, and told him, that he had a great Devotion to go viſit our Lady of <hi>Mont-ſerral,</hi> deſiring him till his return to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Houſe all his ſervants, becauſe he had a deſire to travel alone; to which the Gentleman conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But his Wife, who had in her heart that great Prophet called <hi>Love,</hi> did incontinently ſuſpect the truth of the voyage, and could not contain her ſelf from ſpeaking to him, and ſaid, Monſieur, the Lady
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:119929:143"/>which you are going to adore, is not out of the walls of this City; wherefore, above all things, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to have a care of your health, eſpecially of the health of your ſoul. He who did both fear and love her, did bluſh ſo much to hear thoſe words, that without ſpeaking any thing, his cheeks did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe the truth thereof unto her, and upon that he departed; and having bought two gallant <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jennets he diſguized himſelf in the habite of a Horſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, and ſo diſcoloured his face, that none could know him. The Gentleman who was Husband to this fooliſh Lady, who above all things loved Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, having beheld thoſe two which Signior <hi>D' Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> had brought with him, did incontinently buy them, and having well looked upon the Horſekeeper that did bring them, he demanded of him, if he had a mind to ſerve him? Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> made anſwer, Yes, and told him, That he was a poor young Man that had no other way to live, but only by dreſſing and looking to Horſes, in which he could ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf, that he was moſt conſident that he would reſt content. The Gentleman being very glad of it, did give him the charge of all his Horſes, and entring into his houſe, he told his Wife, That being to go unto the Caſtle, he did recommend his Horſes and his Horſman to her.</p>
               <p>The young Lady, as well to pleaſe her Husband, as having no other recreation, did go unto the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and looked upon the Horſes, and obſerved the new Horſekeeper, who ſeemed to her to be a very handſome young Man, but ſhe had not the leaſt knowledge of him. He, when he perceived that he was not known by her, did approach to make his reverence to her after the manner of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken her by the hand, he kiſſed it, and kiſſing of it, did lock her hand ſo faſt in his, that preſently ſhe knew him; for in dancing with her heretofore he oftentimes would uſe the ſame; From that time the young Lady ceaſed not to ſeek out ſome place
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:119929:143"/>where ſhe might diſcourſe with him by her ſelf; which ſhe did the very ſame Evening; for being invited forth to a Feaſt whither her Husband would have her to go with him, ſhe feigned that ſhe was ſick, and not able to go. Her Husband, who would, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint his friends, did ſay unto her, Sweet-heart, Since you are not pleaſed to go with me, I pray have a care of my Dogs, and my Horſes, and ſee that they want nothing.</p>
               <p>The young Lady found this Commiſſion very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable unto her, and without making any other apparence, ſhe ſaid unto him, That ſeeing he would not imploy her in any better buſineſs, ſhe would make him underſtand in the meaneſt ſervices how much ſhe deſired to be complacent to him. Her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was no ſooner out of the Gate, but ſhe came down into the Stable, where ſhe found divers faults, and to redreſſe them ſhe imployed all her Grooms on ſo many errands, that ſhe remained alone with the Maſter Horſekeeper; And for fear that any one ſhould interrupt her, ſhe ſaid unto him, Go into the Garden, and ſtay a little in the Cabinet which is at the end of the Allee. Which he ſo readily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that he had not the leiſure to thank her; and after ſhe had given orders to all the Grooms of the Stables, ſhe did go to ſee the Doggs, taking the like care that they might want nothing ſitting for Doggs to have, inſomuch, that of a Miſtreſſe ſhe was become a ſervant-maid. Returning to her Chamber, ſhe ſound her ſelf ſo weary, that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſhe did go to bed, ſaying that ſhe would take a little reſt, and all her women left her, excepring one whom ſhe truſted, to whom ſhe ſaid, Go into the Garden, and bring him hither to me whom you ſhall find at the end of the Allee. The Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid did go thither, where ſhe found the Maſter Horſe-keeper, whom ſhe brought immediately to the Lady, who commanded the Maid to go forth, and watch when her Husband did come.</p>
               <pb n="242" facs="tcp:119929:144"/>
               <p>Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> ſeeing himſelf alone with the Lady did deſpoil himſelf of the habiliments of a Horſe-keeper, he took off his falſe Noſe and his falſe beard, and not as a fearful Horſe-keeper, but as a gallant young Signior, without demanding any leave of the Lady, he did leap boldly into the bed to her, where he was received as the braveſt young man that was in thoſe days, by the moſt wanton of all the Ladies of that Country, and he continued with her until ſuch time as her Husband did return; of which having timely notice he did put on his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and forſook the pleaſures which by ſubtilty he uſurped. The Gentleman coming into the Court did underſtand the diligence which his Wife had uſed to obey him, and gave her many thanks for it. Sweet-heart (ſaid the Lady) I have but only done my duty, but it is true, that if a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row eye be not had over thoſe naughty boys, you will not have a Horſe but will be lean, nor a Dog but will be mangy; But ſince I underſtand their ſloth and your good will, they ſhall be better look'd unto, than they were ever heretofore.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman who thought he had got the beſt Horſe-keeper in the World, demanded of her what ſhe thought of him: I aſſure you Sir (ſaid ſhe) that he underſtands himſelf as well as any Servant you could have choſen, but he had need to be followed and rouzed up, for he is one of the moſt drouzy Knaves that ever I ſaw. And thus the Husband and the Lady did continue in greater Love than heretofore, and forgat all the ſuſpition and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie which he had of her; for before ſhe loved Feaſts, dancings, and the keeping of company, and now ſhe did keep altogether at home, and was conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted oftentimes to wear nothing but a looſe Gown next unto her ſmock, when before ſhe was at leaſt four hours in dreſſing her head: For this ſhe was beloved by her Husband and by all the World: and thus under the veil of Hypocriſie and the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:119929:144"/>of being virtuous, this yong Lady lived in ſuch pleaſure, that neither Reaſon, Conſcience, Order, or Meaſure had any more place in her, which the young and delicate complexion of Signior <hi>D' Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> could not long indure, for he became ſo pale and lean, that without wearing a diſguiſe one might well be deceived in the knowledge of his countenance, nevertheleſſe the fond love which he did bear unto the Woman did rendet his ſen ſes ſo ſtupid and loſt, that he ſtill preſumed on his ſtrength, which by this exceſſe would have failed him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he had a body as ſtrong as was the body of <hi>Hercules.</hi> And being at the laſt conſtrained by his weakneſſe, and adviſed to it by the Lady, who did not love him ſo well being weak and ſickly, as when he was luſty and in health, he demanded leave of his Maſter to go unto his friends, which to his great grief he condeſcended to, and Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> ſaithfully promiſed him, that when ever he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered he would return again to his ſervice.</p>
               <p>In this manner he did goe away on foot, for he had to travel but the length of one ſtreet, and as ſoon as he was arrived at the houſe of the rich man, he found none at home but his Wife, whoſe virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous love which ſhe did bear unto him was nothing diminiſhed by his voyage: but when ſhe beheld him ſo lean and ſo diſcoloured ſhe could not forbear from ſpeaking to him; Monſieur, I know not how it goes with your Conſcience, but your Body is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing the better for your pilgrimage, and I doe much fear that the way in which you have travelled by night hath been more hurtful to you, and hath wearied you more, than all your travells by day, for if you had gone on foot to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> you might have returned more comforted in your ſelf, but not more lean and feeble in your Body; therefore with whomſoever you have been, account her but an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll, and ſerve no more ſuch Images, who inſtead of raiſing from the dead, do make the living look as if
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:119929:145"/>they were in the number of the dead. I ſhould ſpeak more unto you, but if your Body hath tranſgreſſed, I do find it to be ſomuch puniſhed, that I have pity to add any new affliction to you. When Signior <hi>Avanes</hi> had underſtood thoſe words, he was no leſs ſorrowful tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> aſhamed, and ſaid unto her, Madam, I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where heard it ſpoken, That Repentance doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſin ſo cloſe, that it even treads on the heels of it; and I have now proved it by my own expence, and I muſt beſeech you to excuſe my youth, which could not otherwiſe be inſtruct, but by making tryal of that Evil which it did not believe.</p>
               <p>The Lady, changing her Diſcourſe, did bring him to a very rich bed, and did perſwade him to repoſe himſelf in it, where he continued for the ſpace of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes, and fed on nothing but Reſtoratives, and was ſo attended both by her Husband and her ſelf, that one of them were always with him; and although againſt the will and counſel of the wiſe young Lady he had committed the follies which you have heard, yet ſhe never diminiſhed that virtuous Love which ſhe did bear unto him. For ſhe hoped, that having paſſed away his firſt dayes in vanities, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire himſelf to the converſation of an honeſt love, by which means ſhe ſhould have him altogether with her. And during the fifteen dayes which he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in her Houſe, ſhe did give him ſuch good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions tending to the love of Virtue, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to entertain a horror and an indignation againſt the follies he had committed; And looking on this Lady, who in beauty ſurpaſſed the other, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more and more the graces, and the Virtues which were in her, he could not chuſe one day, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though obſcurely enough, to chace all fear from him, and to ſpeak unto her, Madam, I find no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means to be ſo virtuous as you demonſtrate to me, and deſire me to be, than to frame my heart to be altogether amorous of virtue; And I muſt beſeech you, Madam, to inform me, if therein you will not
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:119929:145"/>give me all the aid and advice that poſſibly you can. The Lady being very joyful to hear him enter into ſuch diſcourſe, did ſay unto him, Sir, I do promiſe and aſſure you, That if you will be in love with vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, (as it belongeth to ſo great a Lord as you are) I will ſerve you to attain unto it with all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and the power which God hath given me. Well Madam, (ſaid Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi>) remember your promiſe, and underſtand that God, unknown to Chriſtians but by Faith only, hath vouchſafed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume unto him fleſh, like unto the fleſh of a ſinner, to the end, that taking our fleſh upon him by the love of his Humanity, he might alſo draw our Souls unto him by the love of his Divinity, and is willing to ſerve himſelf with things viſible, to cauſe us by Faith to love things inviſible. In the like manner, This Virtue, which all my life I do deſire to love, is a thing inviſible, and lodged within us, is not to be known, but only by her effects: wherefore it is neceſſary that ſhe aſſumes ſome body, to be known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, which ſhe hath done, and hath inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted her ſelf in your body, it being the moſt pure, and the moſt accompliſhed that ſhe could find; whereupon I do acknowledge and confeſſe you not not only virtuous, but Virtue her ſelf; and I who do obſerve her to ſhine in the veil of the moſt perfect body that ever was, which is yours, will ſerve her and honour her all my life, abandoning all other love that is vain and vicious.</p>
               <p>The Lady no leſſe contented than amazed to hear theſe words to proceed from him, did ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her Joy, that ſhe ſaid unto him, Sir, I will not take upon me to anſwer your Theology, but as ſhe who is more fearing the Evil, than believing the Good, I muſt beſeech you, that on my behalf you will for bear this Diſcourſe. I know very well that I am a Woman, and not only as all others are, but ſo imperfect alſo, that Virtue ſhould do a greater Act to transform me into Her, than to aſſume my
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:119929:146"/>form, unleſſe ſhe would be altogether unknown in this world; for under ſuch a Body as is mine, Virtue cannot be known to be ſuch as ſhe is. Sir, ſo it is, that according to my imperfection I will not ceaſe to bear you that affection which ſhall become a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fearing God and her own Honour, but this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection can never be fully made known unto you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til your Heart be capable of the patience which a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Love doth command; And for the preſent Sir, I do know what Language I am to hold with you; Howſoever you may aſſure your ſelf that you love not ſo well your own Good, Perſon, or Honour, as I do love it. Signior <hi>Avanes</hi> being daunted, did make a little pauſe, and taking new Courage, he did humbly beſeech her, That to give him an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of what ſhe ſpake, ſhe would be pleaſed to kiſs him. But ſhe refuſed it, affirming, that for ſo vain a thing ſhe would not break the Cuſtom of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>As they were in this Debate her Husband did come in, to whom Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> ſaid, My Father, I do perceive my ſelf to be ſo much obliged to you, &amp; to your good Wife, that I muſt beſeech you that for ever you will repute me to be your Son, which the good Man moſt willingly did conſent unto; And in the aſſurance of this love, I do intreat you (ſaid Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi>) that I might kiſſe you; Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the good Man kiſſed him, and Signior <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> ſaid unto him, If it were not for fear to offend the Law and Cuſtome of the Country, I would do as much to my Mother your Wife. The Husband, hearing that, did command his Wife to kiſſe him, which ſhe did, without making any appearance to be either willing, or unwilling, becauſe her Husband did command her. Immediatly the fire (which her words before did begin to kindle in the heart of the poor Signior) did vehemently increaſe by her kiſſe, ſo much deſired, and at firſt ſo cruelly refuſed. This being done, Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> repaired to the King
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:119929:146"/>his Brother in the Caſtle, where he told many fine ſtories of his Voyage to <hi>Montſerrat,</hi> and underſtood that the King his Brother was preparing to go to <hi>Olly,</hi> and <hi>Taſſares;</hi> and conſidering with himſelf that the Journey would be long, he was ſurprized with a great ſadneſſe, which conſtrained him to reſolve before his departure to make an eſſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this virtuous Lady did bear him more good will than ſhe ſeemed to do; wherupon he took up his lodgings in a houſe of the City, and in the ſame ſtreet where ſhe lived. The houſe being old, &amp; ruinous, and made of Wood, about midnight he did ſet it on fire, whereupon the Cry was ſo great throughout the City that it came to the houſe of the rich man, who comming to the window demanded what the buſineſſe was, it was anſwered to him, that there was a great fire at the Houſe of Signior <hi>D' Avanes.</hi> He immediatly repaired thither with all his people, and found the young Signior in the middle of the ſtreet in his ſhirt, having pity on him, he took him in his Armes, and covered him with his Gown, and conveying him to his houſe with all the ſpeed that poſſibly he could, he ſaid to his Wife who was in bed, Sweetheart, I give you here this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to keep, uſe him as you would uſe my ſelf: And as ſoon as ever he was departed, Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> who would willingly be intreated by her as if he were her Husband, did lightly leap into the bed, hoping that the occaſion and the place would aler the reſolution of that virtuous Woman; but he found it otherwiſe, for as ſoon that on one fide he leapt into the bed, ſhe made haſt out of it on the other, and throwing her night Gown on her, ſhe came up to the head of the bed, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; How now Monſieur, do you believe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opportunities can alter a chaſt heart? You may aſſure your ſelf, that as Gold is proved in the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, ſo is a chaſt heart in the mideſt of all tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which oftentimes it is proved to be more
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:119929:147"/>ſtrong and virtuous, and doth grow more cold by being aſſaulted by the moſt violent hears: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſt your ſelf aſſured, that if I had any other will than what I have repreſented to you, I could not fail to find means to make you know the injury you would doe me, which not deſiring to uſe, I doe account them nothing. But I muſt deſire you, if you would have me to continue the affection which I do bear unto you, that you would remove far from you, not only the will, but alſo the very thought to find me otherwiſe than I am. During this Diſcourſe her Maids came in, to whom ſhe gave a command to bring her a Collation of all manner of Confects. But he at that time was ſenſible neither of hunger or thirſt, with ſuch a deſperation was he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed that he had failed in his enterpriſe, &amp; he was afraid that the demonſtration which he had made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her of his paſſionate love might be an occaſion to deprive him of all familiarities with her for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Her Husband having given order for the extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing of the Fire, was now returned, and intreated Monſieur <hi>D' Avanes</hi> that he would ſtay in his Houſe for that night, which he conſented to. But the night was paſſed away in ſuch a manner, that his Eyes were more exerciſed in weeping than in ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And early in the morning he came to their bedſide, to bid them Farewell, and kiſſing the Lady, he readily found, that ſhe had more pity of him, than ill will towards him for his offence; and this was a new coal, which over and above was added to the fire of his Love. After Dinner he did ſet forth with the King to <hi>Traſſares,</hi> but before he took Horſe, he did once more repair to the Houſe of his Father and Mother to bid them Adieu, who after the firſt Commandement of her Husband, did make no more difficulty to kiſſe him, than if he had been her own Son. But you may be ſure, that the more that Virtue did forbid her to reveal her hidden
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:119929:147"/>flame by her eyes, and by her countenance, the more it did increaſe and become inſupportable, inſomuch that (being no longer able to endure the War which Love and Honour had made in her Heart, which nevertheleſſe ſhe had determined with her ſelf never to demonſtrate) having loſt the comfort both of ſeeing and hearing him for whom ſhe lived, ſhe was ſurprized by ſo violent a Feaver, occaſioned by a continual melancholly, that the outward parts of her body became cold, although ſhe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned inceſſantly within. The Phyſicians, in whoſe hands the health of men doe always depend, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to doubt of her recovery, by reaſon of her great oppilation, which did render her ſo melancholy, and counſelled her Husband to adviſe her to make her peace with the Phyſician of her Soul.</p>
               <p>The poor Husband, who moſt intirely loved his Wife, was oppreſſed with ſo extream a ſorrow by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe words, that to comfort himſelf, he did write to Signior <hi>D' Avanes,</hi> beſeeching him to take the pains to come and ſee him, hoping alſo that his ſight would conduce ſomething to the health of his Wife; Signior <hi>D' Avanes,</hi> having received the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did make no delay at all, and came in Poſt to the Houſe of his Father: At the entrance into the houſe he found the Men ſervants and the Maid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants making ſo great a lamentation as the loſſe of ſo good a Miſtreſſe did deſerve, whereat the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior was ſo amazed, that he ſtayed at the door like a man in a trance; the good old man his Father ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him did make haſt to imbrace him, and began to weep ſo abundantly, that he was not able to ſpeak one word. He brought him into the Chamber where his Wife was, who turning her languiſhing eyes towards him, did give him her hand, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with it towards her, with all the ſtrength ſhe had, ſhe imbraced him, and kiſſing him again and again did make a marvellous complaint, and ſaid unto him, O Sir, the hour is now come that all
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:119929:148"/>diſſimulation muſt ceaſe, and that I muſt confeſſe the truth which I have ſo much indeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from you. It is, that if you for your part have born any love to me, you may believe that my love hath been altogether as great as yours: but my affliction hath ſurpaſſed yours, becauſe I have taken ſuch pains to conceal it againſt my own heart. For Sir, you are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that God and my Honour did not permit me to declare it to you, fearing that I ſhould add that unto you which I had a deſire to diminiſh. But know Sir, that the word of Denyal which I have ſo often ſpoke unto you, hath done me ſo much prejudice to pronounce it, that it is the occaſion of my death, with which I am well contented, ſince God hath made me ſo happy, that neither the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor the exceſſe of my love hath blemiſhed at all my conſcience or reputation: For with a far leſſe Fire than is mine, there hath been far greater, and more noble ſtructures ruined. But now I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part contented, that before I die I ſhall declare my affection to you to be equal unto yours, nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, but that the honour of men and women are not alike. I ſhall deſire you Sir for the time to come that you will enforce your ſelf to make no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes but to the moſt noble and moſt virtuous La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for in their hearts do dwell the ſtrongeſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and are alwayes moſt wiſely managed; and the Grace, Beauty, and Civility which is in you will not permit that you ſhall be fruitleſſe; And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſo to remember me, and to think of my conſtancy, as that you will not impute that unto cruelty which is to be attributed to Honour, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and Virtue, which ought a thouſand times to be more dear unto us than life it ſelf. Now Sir, I ſhall bid you farewell, and commend you to the good man whom you vouchſafe to call Father, and who is my Husband, to whom I muſt beſeech you
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:119929:148"/>to declare the truth what you know of me, that he might throughly underſtand how much I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God and himſelf, and I muſt beſeech you to forbear to come any more before my eyes, for the few hours I have to live I will altogether imploy them in the meditation of the promiſes which God hath made unto me before the Creation of the World, and ſpeaking theſe words ſhe gave him the laſt kiſſe, and imbraced him with all the force of her feeble arms.</p>
               <p>Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> who had his heart within him as ſurprized with compaſſion as was hers with the Agony of Death, being not able to ſpeak one word unto her, did withdraw himſelf from before her, and threw himſelf upon a Bed which was in the next Chamber, where oftentimes he ſwouned away. Not long after the Lady called for her Husband, and having made many honeſt remonſtrances unto him, ſhe did recommend unto him the care of Signior <hi>D' Avanes,</hi> aſſuring him that next unto himſelf he was the perſon whom ſhe beſt loved in the World; And kiſſing her Husband ſhe did bid him adiew. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly afterwards ſhe commanded that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar ſhould be brought unto her, and after that the Unction, which ſhe received with great joy, as being aſſured of her Salvation: And finding that her eyes began to grow dim, and all her ſtrength to fail her, ſhe did ſpeak aloud her <hi>In manus.</hi> At that Cry Signior <hi>D' Avanes</hi> did riſe from the bed, and looking compaſſionatly on her, he came in a ſweet ſigh to render his Soul unto her, as ſhe was rendring her Soul unto God, to whom ſhe was going; and when he perceived that ſhe was dead, he did run to the dead body (to which being alive he durſt not approach but in fear) and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, and kiſſed it in ſuch a manner that with much difficulty they did take her from between his Arms; her Husband was much aſtonied at it, for he never
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:119929:149"/>perceived that he did bear ſuch an affection to her, and ſaying to him, Sir It is too much, they both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from her; And having made a long lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one for the Death of his Wife, the other for the Death of his Friend, Monſieur <hi>D' Avanes</hi> did give him an account at large of the whole courſe of his Love, and that to her Death ſhe never made any ſigne unto him, but what did expreſſe Severity, and an obſtinate Chaſtneſſe; whereat her Husband being more contented than ever, did double his grief for the loſſe of her, and continued all his life afterwards in doing good ſervices to Signior <hi>D' Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> who was then not above eighteen years of Age. After this he departed to the Court, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued divers years without ſeeing or ſpeaking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Woman in the world, and he did wear mourning apparel two years together for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, you may here obſerve the difference betwixt a wiſe woman and a fooliſh, who do ſhew diſtinctly by themſelves the different effects of love; by which one of them received a death commendable and glorious, and the other did lead a life looſe and infamous: For as the Death of a holy Man or Woman is pretious before God, ſo the Death of a Sinner is as displeaſing. Truly</hi> Saffredant (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>you have rehearſed to us as pleaſant a Hiſtory as I have ever heard; and he who knew the perſons as well as my ſelf, would find it yet more pleaſant, for I have never ſeen a braver Gentleman, nor of a greater Gracefulneſs, than the ſaid Signior</hi> D' Avanes. <hi>Do you think</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>that a wiſe and a young Woman (to diſſemble her love, which the counſel of Nature doth admit that ſhe ſhould bear to ſo deſireable a Gentleman) ſhould ever ſuffer her ſelf to dy, for denying her ſelf that pleaſure of which ſo violently ſhe deſired the content, covertly, and he openly? If ſhe had ſuch a deſire</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>ſhe had place and occaſion enough to declare it to him; but her Virtue was ſo great, that ſhe would not ſuffer her deſires to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her reaſon. You may paint it forth unto us</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:119929:149"/>Hircan) <hi>as you pleaſe, but I know, that the worſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil always doth turn out the other, and that Pride and Hypocriſie did turn from her away her pleaſure; for La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies robes are ſo long, and ſo woven with diſſimulation, that we cannot know what they carry within them; for if they were not more nice of their honour than we are, we ſhould find that Nature had forgot her ſelf no more in them, than in Men: And by reaſon of the fear they have not to dare to take the pleaſure they do deſire, they have changed that vice into a greater, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be more honeſt, and that is into a Glory and a Cruelty, by which they hope to purchaſe themſelves an Immortality; and thus they boaſt they can reſiſt the vice of the Law of Nature. If our Nature be vicious, what is theirs? who not only make themſelves like unto Beaſts, which are inhumane and cruel, but alſo like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Devils, from whom they receive their Pride and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation. It is pity</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>that you have ſo virtuous a Lady to your wife, ſeeing you do not only undervalue Virtue in another, but would prove all Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be vitious. I am happy</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>to have a Wife who is not ſcandalized, and I would not have her to be ſo; but as for that Chaſtity of Heart you ſpeak of, I believe that ſhe and I are both of us the Children of</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve; <hi>wherefore in beholding our ſelves we ſhould not only cover our nakedneſſe with leaves, but alſo confeſſe our frailty. I know</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>that we do all ſtand in need of the Grace of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are inclined unto Sin; but our Temptations are not like unto yours, and if we do ſin through Pride, there is no ſecond prejudiced by it, neither are our hands ſoyled, or our bodies defiled. But your pleaſure doth conſiſt in the diſhonouring of Women, and it is your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to kill men in Wars, which are two poſitions direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to the Law of God. I do confeſſe unto you</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>that you ſpeak the Truth; but God having ſaid, That whoſoever looketh with Concupiſcence is already an Adultereſs in his heart, and that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hateth his neighbour is an homicide; ſatisfie me, I
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:119929:150"/>pray you, Are Women exempted more than Men? God who judgeth the heart</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longaren) <hi>will give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: But it is too much that Men ſhould be our Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; for the goodneſſe of God is ſo great, that he knows and pardons the frailties of our hearts. But let us leave off this Dispute</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>for it doth ſavour more of a Preachment, than of a pleaſant Account.</hi>

                  <hi>Wherefore (ſaid he) I give my voice to</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>deſiring her, that ſhe will not forget to make us to laugh. Truly (ſaid ſhe) I ſhall take care not to fail you, being determined to give a brief account of two ſervants of a Princeſſe, ſo pleaſant, that it doth make me to forget the melancholy of another Hiſtory which I had an intent to exhibit unto you, and to put ſome mirth upon my face to make it appear more agreeable unto you.</hi>

               <p>IN the City of <hi>Ambois</hi> there dwelled the Servant of a Princeſſe, who was Groom of her Chamber, an honeſt Man, and who gave good entertainment to all that came unto his Houſe, but above all to his Companions. It is not long ſince, that one of the Secretaries of his Miſtreſſe did come thither to lodge, where he ſtayed ten or twelve dayes. This Secretary was ſo deformed, that he ſeemed rather to be King of the Canibals, than a Chriſtian. And although his Hoſt, who was alſo his Companion, did intreat him as his Brother, or his deareſt friend, and with all the honour that poſſibly he could, yet he did go about ſuch an Enterpriſe, that it did ſeem he had not only fogot all honeſty, but had never entertained any in his heart, which was in a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

Therefore he, who thought that he ſhould gain her to his will, without regarding her age, which was above fifty, and that ſhe was none of the handſomeſt; and without conſidering the good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſhe had to be a very honeſt Woman, and to love her Husband moſt intirely, did inceſſantly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune her.

She ſuddenly did riſe, and did deſire him to go before, and ſaid, ſhe would follow after him. He laughing for joy, with a ſweetneſſe of face much like unto a great Baboon when it is about to feed, did very lightly go up the ſtairs, and with a labouring Expectation attending that which he ſo much did deſire, burning not with a cleer five, but as a great Coal in the forge, did li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten if ſhe were comming up after him; but inſtead of hearing her feet, he did hear her voice ſpeaking unto him, Maſter Secretary, Stay there a little, I am going to my Husband to know of him, If he be pleaſed that I ſhall come up unto you. You may imagin with your ſelves what a face he made when he wept, who did look ſo ugly when he laughed. He immediatly came down with tears in his eyes, and for the love of God did beſeech her to be ſilent, and nor by her words to break the love which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Husband and himſelf.

                  <hi>FRancis</hi> the firſt of that name being in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and his Siſter the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> in his company, ſhe had a Secretary who was none of thoſe who would let any thing fall down on the ground and refuſe to take it up again; inſomuch there was neither Preſident nor Counſellor, which he did not know, nor Merchant or rich man whoſe houſe he did not frequent, and hold intelligence with them. There came into the ſaid City of <hi>Paris</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Bayons</hi> named <hi>Bernard du Ha,</hi> who as well for the diſcharge of his affaires, as for that the Lieutenant Civil was of his Country, did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe himſelf unto him for his Counſel and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>This Secretary of the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repair to viſit the Lieutenant, who was a good Servant of his Maſter and of his Miſtreſſe; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him upon a Holy-day he found neither him nor his Wife at home, but heard <hi>Bernard du Ha</hi> within as buſie as might be with a Viol or ſome other Inſtrument, teaching the Maid-Servants to dance the Morice of <hi>Gaſcogny.</hi> When the Secretary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him he would have made him believe that he did very ill, and aſſured him that if the Lieutenant or his Wife ſhould know of it, they would be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with him: And having ſufficiently laid forth the inconvenience of what he had done, and the danger that might enſue thereon, <hi>Bernard du Ha</hi> did beſeech the Secretary not to ſpeak unto the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:119929:152"/>Lieutenant of it, who ſaid unto him what will you give me, and I will hold my peace? <hi>Bernard du Ha</hi> who entertained not ſo great a fear as he made a ſhew for, obſerving that the Secretary would ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jole him to a forfeit, did promiſe him to give him a Paſty of the beſt Hanch of Gaſcony Veniſon that he did ever ear. The Secretary being well contented with it, did deſire him that he might have his Paſty on Sunday after Dinner, which <hi>Bernard du Ha</hi> did promiſe, and aſſured him that he ſhould not fail of it; Whereupon the Secretary repaired to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman in <hi>Paris</hi> whom above all Creatures he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to eſpouſe, and ſaid unto her, Madam, If you pleaſe, I will come on Sunday next to ſup with you, but you are to take care for nothing but only good bread and good Wine, for I have over-reached ſo hanſomly a Merchant of <hi>Bayons,</hi> that all the reſt ſhall be at his expence, and by my fine circumventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, you ſhall eat of the braveſt Hanch of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon that ever was brought from <hi>Gaſcogny</hi> to <hi>Paris.</hi> The Gentlewoman who did believe him did ſend for three or four of the moſt conſiderable of her Neighbours, and did aſſure them of ſomething which was very dainty, and which they never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of before.</p>
               <p>When Sunday was come, the Secretary was fain to look after the Merchant, and finding him upon the bridge he graciouſly ſaluting him ſaid unto him, The Devills take you all of them, what a trouble have you put me to to find you out? <hi>Bernard du Ha</hi> replyed unto him, many men have taken more pains than you, who have not been recompenſed with ſuch a preſent, And ſpeaking thoſe words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he ſhewed him the Paſty which he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath his cloak, and was big enough to feed a whole Camp, at which the Secretary was ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, that having made up his wide mouth he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily took it, and leaving the Merchant in the ſtreet without inviting him to cat of his own Veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:119929:152"/>he brought his Preſent to the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, who had a great deſire to know, If the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands of <hi>Guyen</hi> were as good as the Dainties of <hi>Paris.</hi> The hour of Supper being come, as they were ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pottage, the Secretary ſaid unto them, Let us leave off this watry Diet, and taſt of this Flagon of Wine; and ſpeaking thoſe words he uncovered the Paſty, and thinking to cut up the Hanch, he did find it ſo extremely hard, that he could not put his knife into it; wherefore he uſed the utmoſt of his ſtrength, and found that it was a broad piece, or Sabot of wood, of which their ſhooes are made in <hi>Gaſcoigny,</hi> to which, on each ſide, he had placed two great brands taken out of the Chimney, and ſtrowed on the tops thereof the Duſts of ruſty Iron, mingled with foot, which could not but render a gratefull ſmell. Who was perplexed now? It was the Secretary, as much that he was deceived by him whom he thought to deceive himſelf, as alſo that he had deceived her to whom he thought that he had ſpoken the Truth. And on the other ſide, he was no wiſe pleaſed to content himſelf only with pottage for his Supper; The women, who were altogether as ſorry as himſelf, had accuſed him for his Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, but that they perceived by his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that he did partake with them in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe.</p>
               <p>Having thus contrary to his expectation made but a light Supper, he departed in a great choler.

But the Artifice of Love doth ſhew it ſelf by ſo much the more cleerly, by how much it finds leſſe apprehenſion and capacity in the Subjects it doth work upon. And to manifeſt this, I will account unto you what a Prieſt did do, being only inſtructed by Love; for he was ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in all other things, that he could hardly ſay his Maſſe.</hi>

               <head>An honeſt Labourer in the Village, who did ſuffer himſelf to he eaſily deceived by his Wife, who was amorous of the Curat.</head>
               <head type="sub">The ninth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the County of <hi>Mayn,</hi> in a Village called <hi>Arcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> there was a rich Man a labourer, who in his old Age married a handſom young Woman, who had no Children by him, but for that loſſe ſhe did comfort her ſelf with many Friends; and when Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of apparence, and her Friends did fail, ſhe did go to the laſt Recourſe, which was the Church, and took him to be the Companion in her Sin, who ought to abſolve it. This was the Curat, who good man, came very often to viſit this tender Lamb. Her Husband being of a heavy and lumpiſh ſpirit had not the leaſt ſuſpition of her, but becauſe he was of a churliſh conſtitution, and very ſtrong ſhe managed the affair as ſecretly as poſſibly ſhe could; fearing if he ſhould perceive her, that he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedſy kill her. One day when he was abroad, his Wife not thinking that he would return ſo ſoon, did ſend to ſeek out Monſieur the Curat to confeſſe her; And as they were making good cheer together, her Husband did arrive ſo unexpectedly, that he had not the leiſure to retire into his own houſe, but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up and down where to hide himſelf, by the counſel of the Woman he did climb up into the Granary, and covered the trap-door with a Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>The Husband came into the houſe, and ſhe (that he might entertain no ſuſpition) did feaſt him ſo well at Dinner, that ſhe ſpared for no Meat or Wine, of which he did drink ſo great a quantity, that with the wearineſſe of his labour in the fields, he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dinner a great deſire to ſleep, being ſeated in a Chair before the fire. The Curate, who was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:119929:154"/>to be ſo long in the Granary, hearing no noiſe in the Chamber, did open the trap-door, and ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching forth his neck, as far as ever he could, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the good Man was aſleep, And looking down upon him, he not minding of it, did lean ſo hard upon the Bolter with all his weight, that both Bolter and Man did fall down cloſe to the good Man where he was aſleep, who awaked at the great noiſe. The nimble Curat, who had got up upon his leggs before the other had thoroughly opened his eyes, did ſay unto him, My good Friend, behold your Bolter, and many thanks; and having ſaid thoſe words, he did go away with all the haſt he could make.</p>
               <p>The poor Labourer being much amazed, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of his Wife what was the buſineſſe? who made anſwer to him, Sweet-heart, It is that Bolter of yours which is made in faſhion of a Boat, which the Curat having borrowed, hath brought it back again unto you. Her Husband grumbling at it, ſaid unto her, He hath returned clowniſhly enough that which he borrowed; for I thought the whole houſe was falling down upon my head. By this means the Curat did ſave himſelf, and the good Man found nothing amiſſe at all, but onely the rudeneſſe which he uſed in bringing back his Bolter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, the Maſter whom he ſerved did ſave him at that time, that he might take the greater poſſeſſion of him, and tormont him afterwards the longer. Do not imagin (ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>that poor people are more exempt from Excuſes than our ſelves? nay they have a great deal more: For if you look upon Thieves, Murderers, Sorcerers, Coyners of falſe money, and all ſuch kind of people whoſe ſpirits are never at reſt, you ſhall find them all to be poor people, and Mechanicks. It is not ſtrange at all to me (ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>that ſubtilty ſhould reign more amongſt them, than others; For I have heard that Love doth torment them amongſt all their labours,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:119929:154"/>neither is there a heart ſo tough, but this gentle paſſion doth poſſeſſe it. Madam (ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>you are not ignorant what Mr.</hi> John De Moon <hi>ſaith, That Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are as common in the Cottages of Beggers, as in the Palaces of Kings; And the Love (of which this Account ſpeaketh) is not that love which makes us to bear arms in the field; For although poor Men have not our wealth nor honours, yet they have other commodities, more for their comfort then we have; Their viands are not ſo dainty, but they have a better appetite, and they are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nouriſhed with brown bread, than we are with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoratives; They have not beds ſo rich, nor ſo well made as ours, but they do reſt better in ſtraw, and do ſleep ſounder; They have no Ladies painted, nor ſo gorgeouſly ſet forth as thoſe whom we do Idolize, but they have their pleaſures more often than we have, and fear no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eyes, but the Birds and the Beaſts that do behold them. Briefly, in that which we have they do want, and in that which we want, they do abound.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I pray you (ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>let us leave off this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of peaſants, and before that Veſpers do begin let</hi> Hircan <hi>put a period to this third days Journal.

               <head>A marvellous Example of humane frailty in a Lady who to have her Honour concealed did fall from bad into worſe.</head>
               <head type="sub">The tenth Novel</head>
               <p>IN the time of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, one of the houſe of <hi>Amboys</hi> named <hi>George,</hi> being then Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat in <hi>Avignon,</hi> and Nephew to the Legat of <hi>France,</hi> had a Lady in the County of <hi>Languedock,</hi> whoſe name I will conceal for the Love I doe bear unto her Family, ſhe had yearly about four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns in Rent, and was a Widdow in a very young age, being the Mother but of one Son; And for the grief for the loſſe of her Husband, and for the love ſhe did bear unto her Infant, ſhe reſolved with her ſelf never to marry again, and to avoid all occaſions enducing thereunto, ſhe refuſed to keep company with any, but only with people of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thinking with her ſelf that it is opportunity that makes ſinners. This young Lady <hi>Dowager</hi> did altogether addict her ſelf to the reading of Godly books, and did eſchew all companies that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the World; Inſomuch that ſhe made Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to aſſiſt at any marriage, or to hear the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to play in the Church. When her Son arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the age of ſeven years, ſhe took a Man of a holy converſation to bring him up at School, by whom he might be indoctrinated in all virtues, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and divine. When her Son was of fifteen years of age, Nature who is the moſt ſecret School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter finding him high fed, and living a life as ſlothful as luxurious, did teach him another Leſſon than ever the Doctor did, for he began to behold and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thoſe things which were beautiful, and amongſt others a young Maid who did lie in his Mothers Chamber, of which not any had the leaſt ſuſpition, for the Woman took no more regard of him than if
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:119929:155"/>he had been ſtill an Infant, and becauſe that all the houſe over there was no other talk but of God only. This young man began privatly to court this Maid, who could not be quiet for him, inſomuch that ſhe came to her Miſtreſſe and did acquaint her with it, who did ſo much love and eſteem her Son, that ſhe conceived with her ſelf that the Maid had made this report unto her of him only to cauſe her to hate him; But ſhe ſo often did preſſe her Miſtreſſe concerning it, that ſhe ſaid unto her, I will know if it be true or noe, and if I find it to be true accordingly as you report it, I will chaſtiſe him; but if it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be otherwiſe, and the report ſhall be found to be falſe, be ſure that you ſhall endure puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And to make tryal of it, ſhe did command her to appoint her Son a ſet time to come at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to lye with her, in her chamber, in the bed hard by the door where the ſaid Damoiſel was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to lie alone. The Damſel obeyed her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, and when the night came, the Lady did put her ſelf into the Maids bed, being reſolved that if it were true as the Maid reported, ſhe would chaſtiſe him ſo well for it, that ſhe would make him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member whiles he lived how he lay with a woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Being in this determination and choler, her Son did come at the ſet hour to lie with her. She, who for all ſhe ſaw him come into the Bed to her, did believe that he would not commit the diſhoneſt act it ſelf, and deferred to ſpeak unto him, till ſhe knew ſome evident ſign of his hot will, believing that his deſires would content themſelves with ſome ſmall pleaſures, and not proceed unto the Act it ſelf. But her patience was ſo ſtrong, and her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo frail, that forgetting the Name of a Mother, ſhe converted her choler into an abhominable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; And as the water by force retained, doth run with a greater impetuouſneſſe when way is made for it, than when it runneth in its ordinary courſe, ſo this poor Lady did forfeit her glory by the reſtraint
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:119929:156"/>which ſhe did give unto her ſelf: For when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deſcend from the firſt degree of her honeſty, ſhe found herſelf ſuddenly tranſported to the laſt, and ſhe herſelf was great with child by him whom ſhe watched to keep another from running into the ſame enormity with him.</p>
               <p>This Sin being committed, the remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did bring unto her ſo great a torment, that her repentance did not leave her during her life. Riſing from her Son, who alwayes afterwards thought it had been the Maid, ſhe entred into her Cabinet, where calling to mind her good reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and her bad execution of it, ſhe paſſed away all that night in tears and lamentations hy her ſelf. But inſtead of humbling her ſelf as ſhe ought to doe, and acknowledging an impoſſibility in her ſelf, and the perverſeneſſe of her fleſh, which without the grace of God can do nothing elſe but fin, thinking of her ſelf, and by her own tears to give fatisfaction for what was paſſed, and by her own prudence to eſchew all evil to come, excuſing her ſin by the occaſion, and not imputing it to her own weakneſſe, for which there is no remedy but only the grace of God, ſhe reſolved with her ſelf that ſhe would doe a thing whereby ſhe would never fall into the like inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience again: And as if there were but one kind of ſin to condemn her only, ſhe indeavoured with her ſelf for the time to come to avoid that ſin. But the root of Pride did increaſe continually in her heart, inſomuch that eſchewing one evil ſhe committed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others; for the next morning as ſoon as it was day, ſhe ſent for the Governour of her Son, and ſaid unto him, My Son begins to grow up, it is time to ſend him to travel, I have a Kinſman that is on the other ſide of the Hills with Monſieur the Grand-Maſter <hi>Chaumont,</hi> who will be very glad to give him entertainment, I would deſire you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to goe along with him, and that I may take no grief at his departure, let it be your care that he
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:119929:156"/>comes not to me, not ſo much as to crave my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and ſpeaking thoſe words, ſhe did give him ſo much money as was neceſſary for the Journey. On that morning the Young-man departed, who was very glad of it; for he deſired nothing more, than after his Pleaſure with his Sweet-heart to travel to the Wars.</p>
               <p>The Lady continued a long time in a great me lancholy, and were it not that ſhe had the fear of God before her eyes, ſhe had oftentimes made an end of that unhappy fruit with which her womb was pregnant; wherefore ſhe for many moneths preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her ſelf to be ſick, that her Night-Gown might cover her Imperfection; And when ſhe was ready to lye down, finding there was none in the world in whom ſhe had ſo much conſidence, as in her Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard Brother whom ſhe had endued with great poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, ſhe ſent to ſeek him, and did acquaint him with her misfortune (but ſhe did not confeſſe unto him who was the Father of the Fault) and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him to be carefull to preſerve her Honour, which accordingly he did: Some few dayes before ſhe was brought to bed, he counſelled her to change the air, and to make uſe of his Houſe, where ſhe might better recover her health, than in her own. She repaired thither with a very ſmall Retinue, and found a Midwife prepared for her, who was ſent for under a pretence to come unto her Brothers Wife; this Midwife, one night, without knowing who was the Mother of it, did receive the Infant, which was a very pretty Girl. The Gentleman did deliver it to a Nurſe, and cauſed her to bring it up, as if it had been his own child. The Lady having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued there the ſpace of one moneth, did return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her own houſe, where ſhe lived more auſterely than before, obſerving dayes of abſtinence, and all manner of religious diſcipline. But when her Son came unto age, and found that at preſent there was no warre in <hi>Italy,</hi> he ſent to his Mother, to beſeech
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:119929:157"/>her that he might return to her Houſe. She fearing to ſall again into her former Evil, would not permit him; but in the end he ſo far importuned her, that in reaſon ſhe could not refuſe him. Nevertheleſſe ſhe commanded him, That he ſhould not come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, unleſſe he were married to ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman whom he loved very well; and ſent him word withall, that ſhe did not look after any great Fortune, but if ſhe were a Gentlewoman of good Education it was ſufficient.</p>
               <p>During this time, her Brother the Baſtard ſeeing the Girl of which he had the charge to grow into years, and to be accompliſhed with perfections, he determined with himſelf to ſend her to a Houſe at ſome diſtance from him, where ſhe ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and by the Counſel of her own Mother, he did give her unto the Queen of <hi>Navarre.</hi> This Girl, whoſe name was <hi>Katherine,</hi> was then thirteen years of age, and had her beauties accompanied with ſuch a gracefulneſſe, that the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> did love her very well, and had a great deſire to marry her to ſome perſonage of Honour; but becauſe ſhe had no portion that was conſiderable, ſhe had many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but no Husband.</p>
               <p>It fell out one day, that the Gentleman, who was her Father unknown, returning into this ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> did addreſſe himſelf unto the Court of the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> where whenever he obſerved this young Maid, he was very amorous of her; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had leave of his Mother to marry whom he pleaſed, he only inquired, If ſhe were a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman? and underſtanding that ſhe was, he deſired the Queen, that ſhe would be pleaſed to give her in marriage to him, who moſt willingly did conſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, for ſhe knew well enough that the Gentleman was very rich, and, with his riches, that he was handſom and honeſt.</p>
               <p>This Marriage being conſummated, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did write unto his Mother, imparting, That
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:119929:157"/>for the time to come ſhe ought not to ſhut her door any more againſt him, becauſe he had brought with him as accompliſhed a young Gentlewoman as could poſſibly be deſired. The Lady his Mother, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to what allyance he was married, did find, that it was the Daughter of her own Son, and of her ſelf; by reaſon whereof ſhe entered into ſo great a ſorrow, that ſhe thought ſhe ſhould forthwith have dyed, finding, that the more checks and hinderan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhe did endeavour to give to her Misfortune, the more ſhe was the meanes whereby it was increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>Not knowing what to do, ſhe repaired to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat of <hi>Avignon,</hi> to whom ſhe confeſſed the enormity of her Sin, demanding his Counſel how ſhe ſhould demean her ſelf. The Legat, to ſatisfie her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, did ſend for divers Doctors of Divinity, to whom he did communicate the affair, without naming the perſons, and their Counſel was, That the Lady ſhould never ſpeak any thing of it before her Children, who, by reaſon of their Ignorance, were to be excuſed from the ſin, but ſhe ought to repent of it during the whole Courſe of her life, and be carefull to commit the ſame folly no more; And ſo the poor Lady returned to her own houſe, where not long afterwards her Son and her fair Daughter did arrive, who loved one another with ſuch an intire affection, that it was never ſeen that Man or Wife did better agree together; for ſhe was his Daughter, his Siſter, and his Wife, and he was her Father, her Brother, and her Husband. In this love they flouriſhed and continued all the days of their lives, and the poor Lady did continue in her penitence; for ſhe never ſaw them to make much of one another, but it was an Occaſion of Grief unto her.</p>

Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyfilla) <hi>that there are ſuch fools as to believe that opinion? They do a great deal worſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longaren) <hi>for they ſay they can habituate themſelves to the virtue of Chaſtity; &amp; to prove their ſtrength, they diſcourſe with the moſt handſom creatures that can be found, &amp; whom they love the beſt in the world, and with kiſſes and touchings of their hands, they make tryal if their fleſh be mortified, or no; And when by ſuch pleaſure they find any carnal motions, they ſeparat themſelves from one another, &amp; faſt, and diſciplin themſelves with the greateſt ſeverity; And when they have brought their fleſh to ſuch a temper, that neither words nor kiſſes can heat them to any Inſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they come to aſſay the ſtrongeſt and the laſt temptation, which is to ly together, &amp; to imbrace one another without

But not one of a thouſand have attained to this perfection, and from hence there have ariſed ſo many inconveniences, that the Archbiſhop of</hi> Milan, <hi>when this Religion was firſt exerciſed, was adviſed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peparate them for altogether, and to put the Women in the Covents of the Men, and the Men in the Covents of the Women. Truly</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>it is the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and height of Folly, to believe that we cannot ſin, and ſo violently to ſeek out all the occaſions of ſin. There are ſome</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>who altogether do clean contrary to thoſe fools; for although as much as poſſibly they can they do avoid all occaſions of ſin, yet their Concupiſcence ſtill doth follow them, and the good Saint</hi> Hierom <hi>after he had chaſtiſed himſelf, and had retired himſelf into the Deſart, did confeſſe that he could not there eſcape the fire that did burn within him: Wherefore we muſt recommend our ſelves to God, for if by his Power, Virtue, and Goodneſſe, he doth not restrain us, we are ſo weak and wicked of our ſelves, that we ſhall take pleaſure to fall.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the Lands ſubject to the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> there was a Covent of Friers in high Eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neer unto which a Gentleman had his houſe, and did bear ſo great a love to the Religious people that were within it, that he gave them a part in all his Goods, to have a part himſelf in their Abſtinences and Prayers. Amongſt others, there was amongſt them a handſom luſty Frier, whom the Gentleman loved above the reſt, and made him his
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:119929:161"/>Confeſſor, who had as great a command and power in the Gentlemans Houſe as he himſelf. This Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obſerving the Wife of this Gentleman to be ſo wiſe and beautiful, that it was impoſſible to be more, did become ſo amorous of her, that he forgat to eat, and to drink, and began to loſe the light of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Reſolving with himſelf one day to execute his Enterpriſe, he alone repaired to the houſe of the Gentleman; and not finding him within, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of his Wife, whither he was gone? She made anſwer to him, That he was gone to ſome Lands of his about twenty miles from thence, where he intended to ſtay two or three dayes; but if he had any buſineſſe to him, ſhe would ſend a man on purpoſe to inform him of it. He replyed, No, and began to walk up and down the room, as if he had in his mind ſome buſineſſe of great importance; And when he was gon out of the Chamber, ſhe ſaid to one of her Maids, (having at that time but two about her) Go to the Confeſſor, and ask of him, What it is he would have? For I do find by him, that he hath the Countenance of a diſcontented Man. The Chambermaid did go down into the Court, and demanded of him, If he would have any thing? He anſwered, Yes, and taking her aſide to one of the Corners of the Houſe, he drew forth his Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado, which he carried in his ſleeve, and did thruſt it into her throat.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had performed this horrible act, there arrived in the ſame Court a Servant of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, who was on Horſeback, who had brought him Rent from a Farm he had; As ſoon as ever he alighted, he ſaluted the Frier, who imbracing him, thruſt his poynado with all his force into his neck behind him, and did make faſt the out-doors of the Caſtle. The Gentlewoman perceiving that the Chambermaid did not return, did much wonder what was the buſineſſe that ſhe ſtayed ſo long with the Frier, and ſaid unto her other Chambermaid,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:119929:161"/>Go down, and ſee what is the reaſon that your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion doth not return. The Chambermaid did as her Miſtreſſe did command her, and was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner down the ſtairs, but the Frier came unto her, and inticed her to the ſame corner of the houſe where he killed the other Maid, and did by her, as he did by the other. When he beheld himſelf to be alone in the houſe, he repaired to the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and told her, That it was a long time ſince he was deeply in love with her, and the hour was now come in which ſhe muſt be obedient to him. She, who had never the leaſt ſuſpition of him, did ſay unto him, My Ghoſtly Father, I do believe that if I ſhould entertain ſo wicked a Deſire, you would be the firſt that would ſtone me. The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man ſaid unto her, Come down into the Court, and you ſhall ſee what I have done; When ſhe beheld her two Chambermaids and her Groom killed, ſhe was ſo tranſported with fear, that ſhe ſtood like a Statue without ſpeaking one word. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately this wicked man, who would not delight himſelf with her only for one hour, nor take her by force, did ſay unto her, Lady, be not afraid, You are in the hands of him who doth love you the beſt in the world; And ſpeaking theſe words he did put off his long habit, and did ſhew unto her ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſe religious habit which he carried under his arm, and did preſent it to the Gentlewoman, and withall did threaten her, that if ſhee would not put it on, he would put her alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the number of thoſe whom ſhe ſaw dead before her eyes.</p>
               <p>The Gentlewoman, more dead, than alive, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine with her ſelf to put on a face to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to him, as well to ſave her life, as to gain ſome time, in which ſhe hoped her Husband might return. And according to the Commandment of the Frier, ſhe began to put off her Colf, and was as long about it as poſſibly ſhe could; when ſhe was in her hair
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:119929:162"/>flowing down to her middle, the Frier ſeemed not to regard the beauty of it, he did cut it off as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily as he could, which being done he made her to ſtrip her ſelf into her ſmock, and to put on that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle habit which he had brought, and reinveſting himſelf with his own which he was accuſtomed to wear, he made all the haſt he could out of the doors, taking with him that little pretty Frier, whom for a long time he ſo much deſired.</p>
               <p>But God who hath pity on his Children in their tribulation, did regard tho tears of this innocent. Lady; ſo that her Husband having diſpatched his affairs ſooner than he expected, did return to his houſe the ſame way in which his Wife did goe with the Frier. When the Frier beheld him at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he ſaid unto the diſguiſed Lady his Wife, behold your Husband who is comming yonder, I know if you do look upon him with ſuch a fixed Eye that he may diſcover you, he will take you out of my hands, wherfore go before me, and ſee by no means you turn your head on that ſide that he doth come, for if you make the leaſt ſign, be ſure I will have my Poynado in your tbroat before he ſhall be able to deliver you from me. As he did ſpeak theſe words the Gentleman approached, and demanded of him from whence he did come, He made anſwer, from your houſe, where I have leſt the Gentlewoman your Wife in good health, who doth attend your coming. The Gentleman did ride on without perceiving his Wife, but his Servant that was with him, who was always accuſtomed to entertain the Companion of the Frier, called Frier <hi>Iohn,</hi> did ſpeak unto his Miſtreſſe, thinking ſhe had been Frier <hi>Iohn.</hi> The poor Woman, who durſt not turn her head on that ſide towards her Husband, did not anſwer one word, which made the Groom (fearing that he had miſtook) to ride croſſe the way the better to obſerve her; and without ſpeaking one word unto him, the Gentlewoman made a ſign unto him with her Eyes,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:119929:162"/>which he found to be full of tears. The Groom did ride up unto his Maſter, and ſaid unto him, Sir, In riding on the other ſide of the way, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Companion of the Frier, and I doe find it not to be Frier <hi>John,</hi> but one who doth much reſemble my Miſtreſſe your Wife, who with eyes full of tears did look moſt ſorrowfully upon me. The Gentleman told him that he did ſpeak at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and did not well enough obſerve who it was, and made no account of what he ſaid; But the Groom perſiſting in it, he did beſeech his Maſter to give him leave to goe back, and to come more near unto them, and be pleaſed to ſtay himſelf in the way to be ſatisfied in the event of the doubt. The Gentleman did conſent unto it, and ſtood ſtill to obſerve what was the news which his Groom would bring back unto him: But when the Frier heard him riding after him, and that he called Frier <hi>John,</hi> Frier <hi>John,</hi> ſuſpecting that the Gentlewoman was diſcoverd, he came up unto him, and having in his hand a great Staff, and armed with Iron at the end thereof, he did give the Groom ſo great a blow upon his Ribs, that he did fall off from his horſe unto the ground, and the Frier leaping on him did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cut his throat. The Gentleman who at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance did behold the Groom to fall, thinking it was occaſioned by the fright, or the ſtumbling of his horſe, did gallop up to his aſſiſtance. As ſoon as the Frier did behold him to be within the reach of his Staff, he gave him a blow with it in the ſame manner as he gave his Servant, at the violence whereof the Gentleman being diſmounted, the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er began to drag him and throw him upon his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: but the Gentleman who had a ſtout heart, and an able body, held the Frier cloſe to him, with ſo much force, that he took from him the power to doe him any further miſchief, and made the Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado to drop from his hand, which his Wife imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately did take hold on, and did give it to her
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:119929:163"/>Husband, and with all her force held the Frier by his Cowl, whilſt her Husband did give him many wounds with the poynado, ſo that the Frier deſired pardon, and confeſſed the Truth of all his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The Gentleman (although he might) would not kill him, but intreated his Wife to go home to his Houſe, and bring ſome of his ſervants to him, and to bring a little Wagon with them to convey himſelf to his Houſe with more eaſe, which ſhe did.</p>
               <p>The Frier being deſpoyled of his habit, which he had polluted with ſo much blood and luſt, did run in his ſhirt, and his ſhorn head towards his own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent; But the ſervants of the Gentleman did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, as they were going to their Maſter to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him to bring away the Wolf which he had taken, and did dragg him to his houſe, who did cauſe him to be brought before the Juſtice of the Emperor in <hi>Flanders,</hi> before which Court he confeſſed his villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and it being found by his Confeſſion (and proof made by the Commiſſaries there preſent) that a great number of Gentlewomen, and beautifull Maids had been brought into that Monaſtery by the ſame Art, as this Frier would have brought this Gentlewoman, It was ordered, That the ſaid Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery ſhould be examined, and deſpoyled of thoſe beautiful Larcenies, and that in the perpetual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this Crime, the Monks ſhould be all ſhut up, and be burned with the Monaſtery. By this it may appear, that there is nothing more cruel than Love, when it is grounded upon Vice, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again more commen dable than Love, when it doth dwell in a virtuous heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, I am very ſorry that the truth of theſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts doth not lead us as much to the commendations of Friers, as it doth unto their prejudice; for it would be a great pleaſure to me, in the reſpect of the love which I do bear unto their Order, to know any one of them who would give me a juſt cauſe to praiſe them. But we have ſworn ſo much to ſpeak the truth, that, after the report
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:119929:163"/>of Men ſo worthy to be believed, I am conſtrained not to conceal it: aſſuring you, that when the Friers of theſe times ſhall do any act worthy of memory, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſet it forth far better to their Glory, than I have given you the account of this Truth unto their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.

The greateſt puniſhment which can be given to a Malefactor, is not Death, but to afflict him with a perpetual torment, ſo great, it makes him to deſire it, and ſo little, that he cannot obtain it: juſt

               <p>KIng <hi>Charls</hi> the Eighth of that Name did ſend into <hi>Germany</hi> a Gentleman called <hi>Bernage,</hi> Lord of <hi>Cyure</hi> neer unto <hi>Ambois,</hi> whoſe dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was ſo remarkable in his Maſters ſervice, that he travelled both day and night. One evening he arrived very late at the Caſtle of a Gentleman, where he demanded lodging, which with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was at laſt granted. Nevertheleſſe, when the Gentleman underſtood that he was the Servant of ſo great a King, he did go forth to meet him, and did beſeech him not to be diſcontented at the rudeneſſe of his people; for by reaſon of ſome kinred of his Wives who intended ill unto him, he was enforced to keep his Gate ſhut. Immediately <hi>Bernage</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with the occaſion of his Legation, in which the Gentleman did offer him all ſervice that poſſibly he could in the behalf of the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and brought him into his Houſe, where he did lodge him, and gave him honourable entertainment. The hour of Supper being come, the Gentleman did lead him into a Parlor hung round with very rich tapeſtry, where, as ſoon as the meat was upon the Table, he did behold a Lady of a moſt excellent beauty to come forth from behind the Arras; her head was ſhaven all over, and the reſt of her body cloathed with Blacks of <hi>Almaign.</hi> After the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had waſhed with Monſieur <hi>Bernage,</hi> water was brought to the ſaid Lady, who having waſhed her
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:119929:164"/>hands, did ſit down at the end of the Table, and ſpake not to any one, nor any one to her. Signior <hi>Bernage</hi> did often look upon her, and ſhe ſeemed to him to be the moſt beautiful Lady that ever he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, but only that ſhe looked pale, and withall, was very ſad; After ſhe had eaten a little, ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Drink, which a Servant did bring her in a wonderful veſſel, for it was the ſcull of a dead Man, the edge whereof was round about tipped with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: The Lady did drink twice or thrice in it, and after ſhe had ſupped, and waſhed her hands, ſhe made a low Reverence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o the Maſter of the Houſe, and returned again from whence ſhe came, without ſpeaking any word. <hi>Bernage</hi> was ſo amazed to ſee a thing ſo ſtrange, that he became very ſad, and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. The Gentleman perceived it, and ſaid unto him, I obſerve very well, that you are aſtoniſhed at what you have ſeen at this Table; but becauſe of the civility which I have found in you, I will not conceal from you the occaſion of it, that if in me there be any cruelty at all, you may perceive I have a juſt cauſe for it; That Lady which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, is my Wife, whom I loved better than it is poſſible for any other to love his Wife; inſomuch, that to marry her I did forget all fear, and brought her hither in ſpight of all her Kinred. She alſo did expreſſe unto me ſuch ſignes of love, that I would have hazarded ten thouſand lives to have her always with me, to her own content and mine. Having married her, we lived a long time in ſuch a mutual aſſurance of one anothers love, that I conceived my ſelf to be the moſt happy Gentleman in Chriſtendom. But in a Voyage which I made, (to which my Honour did engage me) ſhe ſo much forgat her own Honour, and her Conſcience, and the Love which ſhe had in to me, that ſhe became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous of a young Gentleman whom I brought up in this Houſe, which, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, I thought not to have found. So it is, that the love which I did bear
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:119929:165"/>unto her was ſo great, that I could not harbour the leaſt miſtruſt of her, untill Experience opened my eyes, and I beheld that which I feared more than Death; wherefore my Love was converted into fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deſpair, and I did watch her ſo narrowly, that one day pretending to go abroad, I did hide my ſelf in that Chamber where now ſhe reſideth, into which, not long after my departure ſhe retired, and cauſed the young Gentleman to come to her, whom I ſaw to deport himſelf with that familiarity, that it did belong to none, but to my ſelf only: when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him to lye down upon the Bed by her, I came forth, and taking him in her arms, I did kill him; And becauſe the guilt of my Wife did appear to be ſo great, that ſuch a Death was not enough, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to puniſh her, I contrived a puniſhment for her, which I believe was more unpleaſing to her than Death it ſelf. I locked her up in that chamber to which ſhe was accuſtomed to retire to receive her greateſt delights, and in his company whom ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved better than mine, into which place I ſent her, incloſed in an armory, all the bones of her friend, hanging as ſome precious Jewels in a Cabinet: and to conclude, (when ſhe eateth and drinketh at the Table before me) that ſhe might not forget the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of him, I cauſe her to be ſerved, inſtead of a cup, with the ſcull of that fond Young-man, to the end that ſhe may both ſee him alive, whom by her fault ſhe hath made her Mortal Enemy, and ſee him dead for the love of her, whoſe friendſhip ſhe preferred above my own. And thus conſtantly at Dinner and Supper ſhe beholds two objects which ought moſt to diſpleaſe her, her Enemy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and her Friend dead, and all by her own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault. For the reſt, I do uſe her as I do uſe my ſelf, only ſhe doth go without any hair at all; for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of hair doth not belong to an Adultereſſe, nor a veil to one that is unchaſt, wherefore ſhe doth go without a veil, and without hair, to ſhow that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:119929:165"/>ſhe hath loſt her honour and her chaſtity. If you pleaſe to take the pains to ſee her once more, I will conduct you to her, to which <hi>Bernage</hi> ſeemed very willing, and deſcended with him into a low place, where he found her in a very fair Chamber fitting alone before the fire. The Gentleman opened a curtain which was before a great Armory where he did ſee hanging all the bones of a dead man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bernage</hi> being touched with compaſſion had a great deſire to ſpeak unto her, but durſt not for fear of her Husband. The Gentleman perceived it, and ſaid unto him, If you pleaſe to ſpeak any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, you ſhall obſerve what words and language ſhe hath; Whereupon <hi>Bernage</hi> immediately ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, Madam, if your patience be equal to your torment, I doe eſteem you to be the happieſt Lady in the World. The Lady having tears in her eyes, did anſwer him with a moſt gracefull hudblenes: I doe confeſſe my fault to be ſo great, that all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils which the Signior of this place (whom I am not worthy to name Husband) can bring upon me, are nothing in compariſon of my deſerts, and the grief I have ſo much to have offended him: And ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe words ſhe did weep abundantly, which the Gentleman obſerving took <hi>Bernage</hi> by the hand and did lead him forth.</p>
               <p>The morning being come <hi>Beruage</hi> departed to put his charge in execution which the King had given him, and taking his farewell of the Gentleman, he could not forbear to ſay unto him, Monſieur, the love which I do bear unto you, and the honour and the privacy which you have ſhewed to me in your houſe do conſtram me to declare unto you, that it ſeems to me (ſeeing the great repentance of your poor Wife) that you ought to look upon her, and to uſe her with compaſſion, and ſince you are but young, and have no children, it will be a great loſſe that ſo noble a Houſe ſhould fall for want of Heirs, &amp;
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:119929:166"/>that thoſe who love you not peradventure will ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed you. The Gentleman who determined with himſelf never more to ſpeak unto his Wife, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with himſelf of this diſcourſe and Counſel of <hi>Bernage,</hi> and acknowledged that he had given him good advice, and did promiſe him that if ſhe perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in this humility he would look with ſome pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on her.</p>
               <p>In this manner <hi>Bernage</hi> departed to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his Commiſſion; and when he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the King his Maſter he gave him all along the Account of what he had done in his behalf, which the King found to be as he expreſſed, and amongſt other things <hi>Bernage</hi> having ſpoken of the beauty of that Lady, the King ſent his own Painter named <hi>John de Paris</hi> to limn that Lady to the life, and bring her picture to him, which (having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of her Husband in it) he performed? And ſome weeks afterwards the Husband after the long penance of his Wife, as well in the deſire to have Children by her, as in the compaſſion of her, did take her again into his bed, and had by her many lovely children.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies if all thoſe who have committed the like fault ſhould drink in the like veſſels, I am ſhrewdly afraid that many gilded cups ſhould be converted into Dead mens Skulls. Now God take us into his keeping, for if his Grace doth not reſtrain us, there is not one here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us but is prone to doe as much; but having our confidence in him, he will preſerve thoſe who confeſſe they are not able to preſerve themſelves; and thoſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies who doe moſt of all confide in their own ſtrength and virtue, are in greateſt danger to be tempted to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg their own infirmity, and be you aſſured that there are very many whom Pride hath made to fall in ſuch a caſe, whiles humility hath ſaved others who were eſteemed leſſe virtuous. The old Proverb doth therefore truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that thoſe whom God keeps are well kept. In my opinion</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>the puniſhment is but
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:119929:166"/>reaſonable, and as juſt as moy be, for as the offence was worſe than death, ſo was the puniſhment worſe than death. I am not of your opinion</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>for I had rather all my life time behold the bones of dead Servants in my Cabinet, than indure to die for them, there is no crime ſo great which cannot be amended, but after death there is no amendment at all. How is that</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longaren) <hi>can you amend your Honour? you know (I am ſure) that after ſuch a misfortune, whatſoever a Woman can doe, ſhe can never recover her honour. Tell me I pray you</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Emarſuite) <hi>if</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen <hi>hath not more honour now amongſt men, than her Sister who was a Virgin. I muſt confeſſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longarine) <hi>that we do praiſe her more, but it is for the great love which ſhe did bear our Saviour, and for her repentance; for if you doe obſerve it, the title of a Sinner doth continue with her ſtill. I care not</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſuite) <hi>what name men give unto me, for if God doth pardon me, and my Husband to boot, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I know of, for which I would die. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Gentlewoman did not love her Husband as ſhe ought</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Dagoucin) <hi>yet I doe wonder that ſhe did not die for grief to behold the bones of him whoſe death ſhe occaſioned by her own offence: Say you ſo</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goucin (<hi>ſaid</hi> Simontault) <hi>are you yet to underſtand that Women are capable neither of grief nor love. Yes (ſaid he) and that is the reaſon that I never dare to tempt their loves, for fear I ſhould find leſſe than I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. You live then</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>like a Plover of the Wind, upon Faith and Hope, we may ſeed you at a cheap rate. I am contented (ſaid he) with the love which I doe find in my ſelf, and the hope I have in the heart of one Lady, which if I know to be ſuch as I hope it is, the extream content thereof would ſo tranſport me that I ſhould not endure it without death. Nay be wiſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>and take heed of that Plague, for it is a dangerous malady I dare aſſure you: But I would know to whom Madam</hi> Oyſilla <hi>will give her voice.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119929:167"/>from her Infancy ſhe was ſo preciſe, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared the leaſt ſign of any worldlineſſe in her: She faſted not only the Faſts commanded by the Church, but many days in the week ſhe made Faſt-days for her private Devotion, and as ſong as any ſervice was ſaid in the Church ſhe never ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from it; wherefore her life was ſo much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by all the people, that every one did come on purpoſe to look upon her as a wonder, and happy was he who could but touch her garment.</p>
               <p>The Curat of the Pariſh was her Brother, a man of about fifty years of age, and of a very auſtere life, and accounted by his Pariſhioners to be a very holy Man, who to outward appearance did intreat his Siſter ſo roughly, that he did in a Houſe keep her ſhut up as in a priſon, at which the people were very much diſpleaſed; and the report of this miracle was ſo great, that the news thereof was brought to the Ears of the Count, who perceiving the abuſe with which all the world was poſſeſt did deſire to take it away; wherefore he ſent the Maſter of the Requeſts and his Almoner (two very accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed perſonages) to underſtand the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who repaired to the place, and to be informed as diligently as poſſibly they could, they did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe themſelves to the Curat, who ſeemed to be much amazed at the affair, and beſought them both to aſſiſt him in the atteſtation of it, which he ſaid he hoped would give ſatisfaction to the World.</p>
               <p>The next morning the ſaid Curat did ſing Maſſe in the Church, at which his Siſter did aſſiſt him on her knees being very big with Child, At the end of the Maſſe the Curat did take into his hand <hi>Corpus Domini,</hi> and in the preſence of all the Aſſembly did ſpeak unto his Siſter, Wicked and Blaſphemous as thou art accuſed to be, Behold here him who hath ſuffered death, and who was crucified for thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I demand, if thou art a Virgin, as thou haſt always aſſured me; She boldly, and without
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:119929:168"/>the leaſt Impreſſion of fear, made anſwer to him, Yes. And how then is it poſſible (ſaid he) that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be great with Child, and yet remain a Virgin? She anſwered, I can give no other cauſe thereof, but that it is only by the Grace of the Holy Spirit, who doth in me that which he pleaſeth. Howſoever, I ought not to deny the grace which God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to me, which is to preſerve my Virginity; for I had never the leaſt deſire to a Husband. Her Brother then ſaid unto her, I give thee here the precious Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to thy own Damnation, if it be otherwiſe than thou allegeſt, of which theſe Honourable perſonages who are ſent hither from the Count, ſhall be the Witneſſes; whereupon his Siſter, who was about thirty years of age, did take this following Oath, <hi>I take the Body of my Lord here preſent to my Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before you Gentlemen, and before you my Brother, that never any Man hath touched me any more than you.</hi> And ſpeaking thoſe words ſhe received the Body of our Lord.</p>
               <p>The Maſter of the Requeſt, and the Almoner, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe words, departed with great Amazement, believing, that amongſt ſuch Proteſtations no Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation could have place, and made report thereof unto the King, perſwading him to believe that which they believed, But he who was wiſe, having tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly conſidered of it, did cauſe them to repeat again unto him the words of the Oath; and having well weighed them, he ſaid unto them, She hath taken her Oath upon the Sacrament, that never any Man hath touched her any more than her own Brother; And I do believe it for a Truth, that ſhe is big with child by her Brother, and would cover her ſin with that diſſimulation; for we who believe in Jeſus Chriſt, already come, ought not to expect any other: wherefore they ſhall both ſuffer, and be burned for their moſt horrible and blaſphemous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: And doe you but put the Curat in Priſon, I
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:119929:168"/>am confident that he will confeſſe the Truth.</p>
               <p>This was performed according to his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but not without the great offence of the People, that ſo holy a man ſhould ſo unjuſtly ſuffer. The Prieſt had not been long under cuſtody, but he confeſſed his wickedneſſe, and that he had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled his Siſter to ſpeak thoſe words, and to carry her ſelf in ſo confident a poſture as ſhe did, to cover the life which they did lead together, not only by a light Excuſe, but alſo by a blaſphemous one, that they might be honoured by all the world. And when it was objected to him, how he could be ſo prophane, as to take the body of the Lord to inforce her to ſwear upon it? He made anſwer, That he was not ſo bold, and that the bread which he gave her was not conſecrated. The Report hereof was made unto the Count of <hi>Angouleſin,</hi> who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Juſtice ſhould be executed on the Frier, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as belonged to ſuch a blaſphemous Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. A little reſpite whereof there was, untill his Siſter was brought to bed, who in the ſpace of a few weeks was delivered of a luſty Boy, and not long after they were both burned; whereat the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were wonderfully amazed, having under a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious mantle, ſeen ſo horrible a Monſter, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a life ſo holy, and ſo commendable, ſo deteſtable a Vice to reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, You may here behold, that the faith of this good Count was not overcome by ſigns, nor exterior mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, knowing well enough that we have but one Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who in ſaying,</hi> Conſummatum eſt, <hi>hath ſhewed, that he left no place for any other to be his Succeſſor in the work of our Salvation. I promiſe you</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la) <hi>it was a great preſumption, under an extreme hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie to cover ſo enormous a ſin with the mantle of Religion, and pretendings to the Holy Spirit. I have heard</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>that thoſe who under the Colour of the Kings Commiſſion do exerciſe cruelties, and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, are doubly puniſhed, becauſe they cover their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:119929:169"/>with the Royal Juſtice; So you may ſee that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, although they prosper for a while under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of Religion, yet ſo it is, that when God ſhall take off that mantle, he doth diſcover, and ſet them open stark naked to all the world, and then their nakedneſſe and enormities are found as loathſom, as their Coverture was honourable. There is nothing more pleaſant</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>than to speak truly what the heart doth think. It is the way indeed to grow fat</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren) <hi>and I believe that you ſpeak your opinion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your Condition. Why, I will tell you</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merfide) <hi>I do obſerve that Fools (unleſſe you kill them) do live longer than thoſe who are wiſe; and I can find no other reaſon for it, but becauſe they do not diſſemble their paſſions: if they are angry, they do ſtrike, if they are joyful, they do laugh; when thoſe who do believe themſelves to be wiſe, do diſſemble their Imperfections, with the poyſon whereof their heart is all over infected. I do believe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>that you ſpeak the truth, and that Hypocriſie, whether it be towards God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, or towards Nature, is the Cauſe of all the Evils which we ſuffer. It would be a brave thing</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>if our hearts were ſo filled with Faith, as to believe on him who is all Virtue, and all Joy, and that we might all, and altogether enjoy him, and freely communicate that Joy to one another. That will be in the hour</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>when there ſhall be no more fleſh on the Bones of Men. So it is,</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla) <hi>that the Spirit of God, which is ſtronger than Death, can mortifie our hearts, without any change of our body. Madam</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>you speak of the gift of God, which is not common to Men. It is to thoſe only who have Faith</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>But becauſe this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood by thoſe who are carnal, let us know to whom</hi> Simontault <hi>will give his voice. I do give it, ſaid he, to</hi> Nomerfide; <hi>for becauſe ſhe hath a merry beart, her diſcourſe cannot be melancholy. In good troth</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>becauſe you have a deſire to laugh, I will give you the occaſion; And to ſhew you
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119929:169"/>how much Fear and Ignorance are prejudicial to us; and that the want of a good underſtanding, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the occaſion of great trouble, I will acquaint you with what happened to two Friers of</hi> Niort, <hi>who, by their ill underſtanding of the language of a Butcher, had almoſt killed themſelves, by the only violence of their fear.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The fourth Novell.</head>
               <p>THere is a Village betwixt <hi>Niort</hi> and <hi>Fors</hi> called <hi>Grip,</hi> which belongeth to the Signiory of <hi>Fors.</hi> One day it fell out, that two Friers comming from <hi>Niort,</hi> did atrive very late in this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Grip,</hi> and lodged in the houſe of a Butcher; and becauſe betwixt their Chamber and their Hoſts, there was but a thin board ill nayled, they had a great deſire to liſten to what the Husband did ſpeak unto his Wife, being in Bed together, and they came up ſo cloſe unto them, that they both laid their ears directly againſt the Bedſtead where their Hoſt and his Wife lay; who not ſuſpecting the vigilance of his Gueſts, did talk in private to his Wife of what belonged to his profeſſion, and ſaid unto her, Sweet-heart, to morrow I muſt riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſee my two Grey Friers, whom I intend to kill, and to ſell them in the Market to make my profit of them. And although by thoſe words he did mean his two Hoggs, whom he called Grey Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo it was, that the two poor Friers who heard that reſolution, did interpret that it was meant by them, and in great fear and trembling they
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:119929:170"/>attended the break of the Day. One of theſe Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is very fat, and the other lean enough. The fat one would have confeſſed himſelf to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, and told him, That the Butcher, not having the fear of God before his eyes, did make no more account to cut his throat, than if he had been an Oxe, or any other Beaſt: And becauſe they were locked up in their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and had no other way down, but muſt paſſe thorough the Chamber of their Hoſt, they both did collect unto themſelves that they were ſure enough to be killed, and did both of them recommend their Souls unto God; But the younger of them, who was not alltogether ſo overcome with fear as his Companion, did ſay unto him, That ſince the Door was locked up, they muſt aſſay to eſcape out of the Window, and come what will, there could come nothing to them worſe than Death.</p>
               <p>To this the fat Frier did conſent. The youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of them opened the Window, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it was not very high from the ground, he did leap lightly down, and ran away as faſt, and as far as ever he could; He being gone, and not ſtaying for his Companion, the corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Frier did attempt the danger, but the weight of his body did conſtrain him to lye where he fell; for inſtead of leaping, he fell down ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily, that he much bruiſed his Legg. When he beheld himſelf forſaken of his Companion, and that he was diſabled to follow him, he looked round about him to find where he might hide himſelf, but he could diſcover no place but a Piggs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty only, to which he did creep as well as he could; and opening the door to go into it, two Hoggs did run out, and eſcaping, grunted their gratitude to him. The poor Frier did poſſeſſe himſelf of their place, and intended, when ever he heard the noiſe of any Travellers that paſſed that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:119929:170"/>way, to call unto them, and crave their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But as ſoon as day appeared the Butcher took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand his two great knives, and deſired of his Wife to keep him company to kill his two fat hoggs. When they came unto the Stie where the Frier did hide himſelf, he opened the door, and cried aloud, come forth my gray Fiers, come forth, this day I ſhall both eat and ſell of your Puddings. The Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being ſtartled, and not able to ſtand on one legge did hop out of the Stie the length of four feet with the other, and cryed out, Mercy, Mercy, as loud as ever he could: And if the Frier was ſurprized with a great fear, much more was the Butcher and his Wife, for they verily believed St. <hi>Francis</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them becauſe they gave the name of a Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto a Hogg, they therefore kneeled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the poor Frier, and demanded pardon of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> and his Religion, ſo that on hoth ſides, the Frier cried and called for mercy of the Butcher, and the Butcher and his Wife on the other ſide cried as loud for mercy to the Frier, inſomuch that they were above a quarter of an hour in this agony of fear before they could underſtand one another. At laſt the Frier perceiving that the Butcher did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no harm, did declare unto him the cauſe wherefore he did hide himſelf in the Hoggs-Stie; whereupon their fear was immediatly diſſolved into an abundant Argument of laughter, which had been greater but the poor Frier who had his Legg ſorely hruiſed (by reaſon of his great pain) could not goe along with them in their mirth, the Butcher there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did lead him to his houſe where he continued until he was well recovered. His Companion who did forſake him in his greateſt need, did run all night long, and in the morning came unto the houſe of Signior <hi>de Fors</hi> where he complained of this Butcher, who (as he verily believed) had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Companion, becauſe he found he did not follow him. Signior <hi>de Fors</hi> did immediately ſend
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:119929:171"/>to the Village of <hi>Grip</hi> to underſtand the truth, which being known, he found there was no argument of grief, and immediatly he made an Account therof to his Miſtreſſe, Madam the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Angouleſm</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that name.</p>

                  <hi>Ladies you may from hence obſerve, that it is not good to liſten to a ſecret, to which we are not called, or give a falſe interpretation to the words which another man doth ſpeak. Did not I know well enough</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Simontault) <hi>that</hi> Nomerfide <hi>would not make us weep, but heartily to laugh, in which I find that every one of us have had their ſhare. And how comes it about</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>that we are inclined to laugh at folly, and not ſo much as to ſmile at any thing that is well and wiſely done? The reaſon is</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>becauſe it is more agreeable unto us, and neer of kin unto our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which of it ſelf is never wiſe, and every one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects that which is like unto it ſelf, and this makes the Fools to be addicted unto Folly, and the Wiſe unto wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But I believe there is neither wiſeman nor Fool that can reſtrain from laughter at the hearing of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. There are ſome</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>who have their hearts ſo addicted to the Love of Wiſdom, that ſay or doe what you will you can never make them langh, for they have ſo moderate a Joy and Contentment in their hearts that no accident can move them. who be they</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan?) Guebron <hi>made anſwer, The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of former times; whoſe joyes and ſorrows were never perceived, ſo great a virtue they eſteemed it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome themſelves and their own paſſions; I doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it as well as they to overcome a vicious paſſion</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>but to ſtrive againſt a natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which doth no hurt to any, it ſeems to me to be impertinent. Howſoever you judge it</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron) <hi>others did eſteem it a great virtue. It is not ſo much becauſe they were wiſe men</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>but becauſe they had no occaſion to teſtifie their grief or joy, and therefore it was rather an apparence than an effect of Virtue. Howſoever you ſhall
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:119929:171"/>find</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Guebron) <hi>that they reproved all Vices, and ſo</hi> Diogenes <hi>himſelf trampled with his feet on</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes <hi>bed, becauſe it was adorned with more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry accoutrements, and</hi> (<hi>to ſhew how much he deſpiſed the vain-glory and the avarice of</hi> Plato) <hi>he ſaid, thus doe I tread upon the pride of</hi> Plato. <hi>But you doe not ſpeak all</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffredant) <hi>for</hi> Plato <hi>ſuddenly replied unto him, It was true that he did tread upon it, but with far greater pride than his own; for</hi> Diogenes <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued and despiſed all neatneſſe in a vain and dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged affectation of Simplicity. To ſpeak the truth</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlement) <hi>it is impoſſible that the victory of our ſelves ſhould be obtained merely by our ſelves, nor can we goe about it without a marvellous preſumption, which is the Vice that every one ought to hate, for from it death firſt proceeded, and is the ruine of all Virtues.</hi>

Of both Sexes</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Hircan) <hi>we men are more near unto Salvation than you Women; for not diſſembling our fruits, you may eaſily know the root, but you who dare not put forth your fruits to the open view, and doe make ſo many gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant appearances, cannot without much difficulty diſcover
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:119929:172"/>the root of your arrogance and preſumption which doth grow up under your fair coverture. I muſt confeſſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Longaren) <hi>if the word of God had not by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of our faith ſhewed us the infidelity hidden in our hearts, we ſhould be all prone to fall into ſome viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble offence; And thrice happy are they whom Faith hath ſo humbled, that they have no need to prove thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <head>The Endeavour and Succeſs of a wiſe Husband to divert the Love which his Wife did bear unto a Preacher.</head>
               <head type="sub">The fifth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Pampelona</hi> there lived a Lady, who was eſteemed to be as virtuous as ſhe was fair, and to be the moſt chaſt, and the moſt devout Woman in all that Country. She intirely loved her Husband, and was ſo obedient to him, that he repoſed all his
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:119929:172"/>confidence in her. This Lady did inceſſantly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Divine Service, and the Sermons. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded her Husband and her Children to hold that reſolution as well as her ſelf, who was then about 30 years of age, at which time women are accuſtomed to leave off the Name of fair, to be reputed Grave. On <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday,</hi> which is the firſt day of <hi>Lent,</hi> this Lady did repair to the Church to hear ſomething for the tribulation of the Fleſh, where ſhe heard a Sermon preached by a Frier, who was eſteemed by all the world to be an honeſt Man, by reaſon of his great auſterity, and abſtinence of life, which did render him both pale and lean, but not ſo altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but for all that he was handſom enough, and a good Companion. This Lady in great Devotion did hearken to the Sermon, having her eyes faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in contemplation of this venerable perſon, and her ear, and all the faculties of her undeſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, were taken up altogether in attention to him; wherefore the ſweetneſſe of his words did enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her ears, and dived down into her heart, and the beauty and grace of his countenance did ſo ſurprize her eyes, and ſo depſerately did invade her Spirit, that ſhe was like a tranſported Creature. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being ended, ſhe diligently attended where he was to ſay Maſſe, at which ſhe aſſiſted, and took the aſhes from his hand, which was as ſlender as her own, and white as the aſhes themſelves. The devout Lady did more regard his hand, than the aſhes he did give her, &amp; did moſt aſſuredly believe that ſuch a ſpiritual love, whatſoever pleaſure ſhe apprehended in it, could never hurt her conſcience; ſhe never failed a day to repair unto the Sermon, &amp; did take her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band along with her, &amp; both the one &amp; the other did give ſo great a Commendation to the Preacher, that both at bed and at board they had almoſt no other Diſcourſe but of him only. And thus the fire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the title of ſpiritual, did become ſo carnal, that being lodged and burning in her heart, it did ſet
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:119929:173"/>all the body of this poor Lady into a flame. And as ſhe was but ſlow to perceive it, ſo ſhe was prone to be inflamed, and firſt found the contentment ſhe received in that paſſion, before ſhe knew that ſhe was ſubjected to it. And thus being in every part ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by her grand Enemy <hi>Love,</hi> ſhe no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted any one of his Commandements; but the greateſt trouble was, that her Phyſician who was to cure her was ignorant of her diſeaſe; wherfore, having put away all fear, (which ſhe ought to have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained) to ſhew her folly before ſo wiſe a Man, and her imperfections before ſo abſolute and ſo virtuous a Preacher, ſhe undertook by writing to diſcover the love which ſhe did bear unto him, which at the firſt ſhe did as gently as ſhe could, and delivered the Letter to a little page, with Inſtructions how to behave himſelf in this ſervice, and, above all, ſhe did give him a ſpecial commandement that he ſhould be moſt carefull that her Husband did not ſee him, as he did paſſe unto the Friers.</p>
               <p>The Page going on directly in his way, did paſſe through a ſtreet where his Maſter by chance was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a ſhop, The Gentleman ſeeing him, did ſtep forth out of the ſhop to ſee which way he did go, and the Page perceiving him (being amazed at it) did hide himſelf in a houſe; His Maſter being ſtartled thereat, did follow him, and taking hold of him by his arm, he demanded of him, whither he was going? and perceiving that the Excuſes he did make were to no purpoſe, and that he had an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted countenance, he threatned to beat him foundly, if he did not tell him whither he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The poor Page ſaid unto him, Wo is me, Sir, If I ſhall tell you, my Miſtreſſe will kill me. The Gentleman ſuſpecting that his Wife had made a Market without his knowledge of it, did aſſure the Page that he ſhould receive no harm, if he would confeſſe the truth, but be well rewarded; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, that if he told him a ly, he would keep him in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:119929:173"/>priſon during his life. The poor Page, to receive good and to eſcape puniſhment, did ſhew him the Letters which his Miſtceſſe had wrote unto the Preacher, whereat her Husband was as much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and grieved, as he was before aſſured of her loyalty, having never before received the leaſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content from her. But he who was wiſe did diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his choler, and (to know the farther intentions of his Wife) did return an anſwer by writing to her Letter, as if the Preacher had thanked her for her good will, and declared to her that he for his own part did bear as much true affection unto her. The Page having ſworn unto his Maſter to carry on this buſineſſe with all ſilence and diſcretion, did return unto his Miſtreſſe, to whom he delived that counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Letter, whereat ſhe was ſurprized with ſo much joy, that her Husband did eaſily perceive it by the change of her countenance, for inſtead of contrition and making her ſelf lean with abſtinence, ſhe did look more freſh, more fair, and more lovely, than before that Lent did begin.</p>
               <p>It was now middle-lent, yet this Lady neither for the holineſs of the ſeaſon, nor the approach of the Paſſion did alter her accuſtomed manner, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by Letters to declare unto the Preacher her furious fantaſie; and it ſeemed to her (poor Lady) that when he turned his eyes on that ſide where ſhe ſat, it was only to look on her, and as often as he did ſpeak of the love of God, ſhe did apply it to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and thought in her interpretation of it, that it was ſpoken altogether for the love of her, and as much as her eyes could ſhew what ſhe thought, ſhe ſpared not to return in glances to him: her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in his Letter failed not to ſend her like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. After Eaſter was paſſed, he did write unto her in the name of the Preacher, and did intreat her to inſtruct him what means he ſhould uſe to come unto her. She, who thought every hour a year until ſhe had returned an anſwer to that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:119929:174"/>did counſell her Husband to take a journey in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country to ſurvay ſome lands which he had there, which he promiſed her to doe, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf in the houſe of one of his friends. The Lady failed not to write unto the Preacher on what hour he might have his opportunity to come and ſee her, for her Husband was gone forth. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman deſiring to make trial of the love of his Wife even to the laſt, did repair unto the Preacher, and (for the honour of God) deſired him that he would be pleaſed to lend him his habit: The Preacher, who was a very righteous man, did aſſure him, that it was againſt the Rules of their order, and that he would not for any thing lend it to have it brought upon the Stage. The Gentleman did proteſt unto him, that he would only uſe it for his own pleaſure, and in a buſineſſe that was neceſſary for the good both of Soul and Body. The Frier knowing him to be an honeſt man, and fearing God, did lend it to him; and with this habit (which covered the greateſt part of his face, inſomuch that ſhe could not ſee his eyes) he took a falſe beard, and a falſe noſe, and near in reſemblance to the Preachers, and he did put a Riſe into his ſhooes that he might be juſt of his height. Thus habited he did come in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, into the Chamber of his Wife, who did attend him with great devotion, and (poor Gentlewoman) could not forbeat till he came to her, but as a Woman out of her ſenſes ſhe did run to meet him, and embraced him: He who held his head down into his boſome for fear of being diſcovered, did begin to make the ſign of the croſſe, and to fly from her, and to cry out aloud, Temptation, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The Lady ſaid unto him, alas my dear Father, you have reaſon for it, for there is no more violent temptation than that which doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Love, to which you have promiſed to give me a remedy, beſeeching you, that now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving time and leiſure you will have pity on me, and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:119929:174"/>ſpeaking thoſe words ſhe did enforce her ſelf to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, but he running from her round about the Chamber, and making many and great ſigns of the Croſſe, did continually cry out Temptation, Temptation; but perceiving that ſhe came up cloſe unto him, and to examine ſome where about him too familiarly, he took a good cudgel which he did carry under his mantle, and did give her ſo many, and ſuch effectuall blowes, that he made her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and forget the Temptation, and being not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by her, he repaired immediately to the Preacher, and reſtored him his habit, aſſuring him that he had received an eſpecial favour by it. The next morning, pretending that he had returned from a long Journey, he came into his houſe, where he found his Wife ſick in bed, and as if he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what had paſſed, he enquired of her the cauſe of her diſeaſe: She made anſwer, that it was a cold ſhe had taken, which was ſo violent upon her, that ſhe could not ſtir either hand or foot. Her Husband (who had a good deſire to laugh) did pretend to be extremely ſorry, and (to adminiſter ſome comfort to her) did acquaint her, that on that Evening he had invited the holy man the Preacher unto Supper. She immediately made anſwer, far be it from you (Sweet-heart) to invite any of that Tribe, for they do bring ill luck with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the houſes whereſoever they doe come. How (my dear Sweet-heart) ſaid her Husband, have you ſo much praiſed this man unto me, and doe you make no more reckoning of him? As for my own part, I doe verily believe, that if there be a holy man in the world, it is verily he. His Wife made anſwer to him, they are good in the Church, and in their Pulpits, but in our houſes they are very Anti-chriſts; I muſt beſeech you Sir (if he doth come) that I may not ſee him, for it will be enough (with the ſickneſſe that already I have on me) to kill me outright. Her Husband ſaid unto her, becauſe you
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119929:175"/>have no mind unto it, you ſhall not ſee him, and therefore he ſhall ſup with me in the Parlor. She made anſwer to him, doe what you pleaſe, but I pray let not me ſee him, for in my own houſe I doe hate ſuch people as I hate the Devil. Her Husband, after he had ſupped with his Ghoſtly Father, did ſay unto him. My Father, I doe eſteem you to be ſo beloved of God, that he will deny you no juſt Petition. I do beſeech you therefore to have pity on my poor Wife, who (for theſe eight days) hath been poſſeſſed with an evil ſpirit, inſomuch that ſhe biteth and ſcratcheth all the World; there is neither croſſing nor holy-water of which ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any reckoning at all; I do believe, that if you ſhall but put your hand upon her, that the Devil will leave her, and in this I muſt beſeech you to do as much for me as lies in your power. The Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor did reply unto him, my Son, All things are poſſible to the true believer; And doe you aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, that the goodneſſe of God refuſeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who in faith demandeth mercy of him? My Father, I doe verily believe it, ſaid the Gentleman. Aſſure your ſelf alſo my Son ſaid the Frier, that he both can doe it, and he will doe it, and that he is no leſſe powerful than merciful. Let us therefore goe in the power of Faith to reſiſt that roaring Lion, and pluck from him the prey which is redeemed by the bloud of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Confeſſor having ſpoken theſe words, the Gentleman did bring him into the Chamber where his Wife was laid upon a Truckle-bed, who was ſo much amazed to ſee him, verily believing that it was he who had beaten her, that ſhe did grow into a wonderfull Rage, as might appear by her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but by reaſon of the preſence of her Husband ſhe did look down with her eyes, and did not ſpeak one word. Her Husband ſaid unto the Holy man, As long as I am with her, the Devil doth not torment her, but as ſoon as ever I am departed from her, do you
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119929:175"/>ſprinkle holy-water on her, and you ſhall quickly ſee how the evil ſpirit will play his pranks. Having ſpoken thoſe words, he did leave the Preacher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with his Wife, and ſtayed himſelf behind the Arras to obſerve their Countenances. When ſhe beheld that there was no man with her but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, ſhe did begin to cry out as a woman inraged, and out of her ſenſe, and called him Villain, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret, and Impoſtor; The Frier (for certain) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that ſhe was poſſeſſed with an evil Spirit, did attempt to take her by the Head, to ſay his Orai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons over it, but ſhe did ſo ſcratch him, and ſo bite him, that ſhe enforced him to ſtand further off, who perpetually ſprinkling her with his holy-water, did number Oraiſons upon Oraiſons.</p>
               <p>When her Husband perceived that he had done his Duty, he came into the Chamber, and gave him many thanks for the pains that he had taken; as ſoon as ever ſhe perceived her Husband, ſhe held both her hands and her tongue, and did forbear all Injuries and Maledictions, and ſtanding in aw of him, ſhe gently did kiſſe the Croſſe: But the Holy Man (who before did ſee her ſo much tranſported) did firmly believe, that at his prayer, our Saviour had caſt the Devil out of her, and departed praiſing God for ſo great a Miracle. The Husband ſeeing his Wife well chaſtiſed for ſo fooliſh a phantaſie, did conceive it not to be ſit to declare unto her what he had done, for he contented himſelf to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her violent affection by his wiſdom, and that he had put her into ſuch a condition, that ſhe now deteſted her own folly, and mortally hated that, which before ſo indiſcreetly ſhe had loved. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this (having abandoned all Preciſeneſſe) ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted her ſelf altogether to her Husband, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her buſineſſe better at home, than ſhe did ever before in all her life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, by this you may underſtand the Diſcretion of a good Husband, and the Frailty of a Woman, that was
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:119929:176"/>eſteemed of a devout and honourable life: I do believe that when you do behold your ſelves in this Mirror, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of truſting in your own ſtrength, you will learn to return to him in whoſe hand all Honour is encloſed. I am very glad, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that you are become a Preacher to Ladies, and ſhould be yet more glad, if you would but continue in this good diſcourſe unto all thoſe with whom you hold communication. As often, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>as you pleaſe to give ear unto me, I am conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that I ſhall not speak otherwiſe. It is as much as to ſay, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that when theſe Ladies are not preſent, you will ſpeak in another ſenſe. That ſhall be, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>as he himſelf pleaſeth; but for my own content, I ſhall believe that he will never ſpeak o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: Nevertheleſs the Example he hath alleged, will ſerve to convince thoſe, who believe that a love ſpiritual cannot be dangerous, which appears to me to be the moſt dangerous of all others. It is true, ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla, <hi>that to love an honeſt Man, and one fearing God, ought not to be a thing we ſhould despiſe, for we ſhould love none but ſuch. Madam, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>I muſt beſeech you to believe, that there is nothing more fooliſh, nor more eaſie to be deceived, than a woman who hath never been in love; For Love, of it ſelf, is a paſſion which taketh poſſeſſion of the heart before we are adviſed of it, and this paſſion is ſo pleaſant, that if it can be ſo far aſſiſted by Virtue, as to put on her cloak, it will not, without much difficulty, be diſcovered, untill ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience ſhall enſue thereby. What Inconvenience can ariſe, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>to love a Man of worth and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour? Madam, anſwered</hi> Parlament, <hi>There are many Men eſteemed Men of Honour towards Ladies, but to be ſo much a Man of Worth towards God that a Lady may love him, and reſerve both her Honour and her Conſcience, I do believe is near unto a wonder, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare to find. And thoſe who are confident there are ſuch; and that there are many of them, will find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the laſt to be deceived; and they have entred into a Love under the Notion of God, the events where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:119929:176"/>doth lead them to the Devil; for I have ſeen too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who, under the Colour of Piety, have entertained a Love, from whence, in the end, they would have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly retired, but could not, becauſe the honeſt Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it did keep them in a fond ſubjection. For a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Love doth of it ſelf defeat it ſelf, and cannot be lodged in a virtuous heart; but a virtuous Love is that which carryeth with it nets of ſilk, ſo finely woven, that we are innocently taken in them, before we do perceive them. If it be as you ſpeak, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>there would never any Woman love a Man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; but your Law is too ſevere to be obſerved by any. I know it very well, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>but for all that I will not leave off to deſire every Woman to be contented with her own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as I am with mine.</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>who by that word did believe that ſhe her ſelf was underſtood, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her colour, did ſay unto her, You ought to judge that every one hath as good a heart as you your ſelf, and not to believe that you are more perfect than all others. Well, well, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that we may enter no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into this Diſcourſe, Let us know unto whom</hi> Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can <hi>will give his voice. I do give it, ſaid he, to</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſuite, <hi>that ſhe may be reconciled to my Wife. Since then, it comes to my turn, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>to make all equal, I will ſpare neither Man nor Woman; and I will make trial, if I cannot overcome your heart once more to acknowledge the Virtue and the Goodneſs of Men, which cauſeth me to follow the trace of the laſt account, by giving you a Hiſtory that hath relation to it.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The ſixth Novel.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Grenoble</hi> there was a Preſident, whoſe Name I will conceal (howſoever he was no <hi>French</hi> man) he had a very handſom Wife, and lived in great peace with her. This Woman obſerving that her Husband was grown old, did fall in love with a Clerk of his, a lovely young fellow, and comming on. Every morning when her Husband repaired to the Palace, the Clerk entred into his Chamber, and poſſeſſed his place. One of the ſervants of the Preſident did perceive it, who having ſerved him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove thirty years, and being loyal to his Maſter, could not contein himſelf from giving him notice of it. The Preſident who was a wiſe man would not lightly give any credence to it, but told him, that he had a deſire to plant Diviſion betwixt his Wife &amp; himſelf; And to prove the truth, he commanded him to ſhew her to him in the manner of it. Which if he could not do, he would believe, he ſaid, that he had contrived that ſlander to make a ſeparation betwixt them. His Groom aſſured him, that what he had ſpoken, he would cauſe him to ſee with his own eyes, and accordingly one morning as ſoon as the Preſident was gone unto the Palace, and the Clerk was entred into the Chamber of his Wife, The Servant ſent one of his fellows to acquaint his Maſter, that he might come at that inſtant and take them together, and ſtayed at the Chamber door himſelf to watch that the Clerk ſhould not come forth. The Preſident had no ſooner this news brought unto him by his Servant, but feigning
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119929:177"/>himſelf to be ſick on the ſudden, and that a great qualm came over his ſtomack, he returned in great haſt to his own houſe, where he found his old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at the door of his Chamber, who aſſured him for certain that his Clerk was within, and that he had not been very long there. His Maſter ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſtir not from this door, for thou knoweſt well enough that there is no other entry nor door but only this, ſaving only a Cabinet within, of which I always take the Key with me. Having ſpoke theſe words, the Preſident entred into his Chamber, and found his Wife and the Clerk both in bed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Clerk ſeeing him, did in his ſhirt throw himſelf down at his feet, and craved pardon of him, and his Wife on the other ſide did begin to weep. The Preſident ſaid unto them, Although the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which you have done me is ſuch, as you your ſelves may well conceive to be unpardonable, yet I doe tender you ſo much, that I will not have my houſe to be diſhonoured, nor my children which I had by you to be diſgraced; wherefore ſaid he to his Wife, do not weep, but obſerve what I will doe, and doe you <hi>Nicholas</hi> (for ſo his Clerk was named) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and conceal your ſelf in my Cabinet, and make not the leaſt noiſe: When he had ſo don, he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the door, and calling in his old Servant he ſaid unto him, Didſt not thou aſſure me that thou wouldſt ſhew me my Clerk lying in bed with my Wife? and on thy word am I come hither, and had taken a full reſolution to kill my Wife; I have not found any thing of what thou haſt ſaid unto me, and yet have thorowly ſearched the Chamber, as I will ſhew unto you; and ſpeaking thoſe words, he commanded his Groom to look under the Bed, and in every corner of the Chamber. When the Groom could not diſcover him, he ſaid to his Maſter in a great amazement; The Devil ſure muſt carry him away, for I will take my oath that I ſaw him goe in, and which way he is gone out, God knows, but out
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:119929:178"/>at this door he is not gone. His Maſter replyed unto him, Thou art a wicked Knave to attempt to make any difference between me and my Wife; wherefore I do charge thee to be gone out of my houſe, and for the Services which thou haſt done me, I will pay thee what I owe thee, and more than what I owe thee; but get thee out of my doors, and be ſure that thou art not in this City fout and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours: And having thus rebuked him, he liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paid him his wages, and gave him a reward for 5 or 6 years ſervice to come, and knowing that he had been a dutiful Servant, he told him, that for all the diſcharging his houſe of him, he might be yet more beneficial to him. The Servant being diſmiſſed and gone, the Preſident commanded the Clerk to come out of the Cabinet, and having (as he thought good) reproved him and his Wife for their irregular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of love, he did forbid them to make any appearance of it to any man, and deſired his Wife to attire her ſelf more gorgeouſly than ſhe was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to doe, and gave her leave freely to goe to all Companies and Feaſts. He alſo did look upon the Clerk with a more friendly eye than he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, and whiſpering him in his ear he bid him to goe into the City, and take his pleaſure there for three or four hours. This being done, the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent repaired to the Palace without making the leaſt appearance of any thing, and for fifteen days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether (quite contrary to his former cuſtom) he did nothing but Feaſt his Friends and Neighbours, and after the Banquet he had Muſick to invite the Ladies to dance.</p>
               <p>One day obſerving that his Wife was melancholy, and did refuſe to dance, he commanded his Clerk to lead her forth into the dance: The Clerk belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he had forgotten all former faults, did with great joy take her by the hand, and uſed many frolicks with her in the dance, but the dance being ended, the Preſident pretending he had ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

The Clerk was very ſorrowful to forſake the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman his Miſtreſſe, but as glad on the other ſide that he had ſaved his own life.</p>

And what would you have had him to have don, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>to revenge himſelf of the greateſt injury that a Woman can do unto a Man? I would, ſaid ſhe, that he had killed her in his choler; for the Caſuiſts ſay that ſuch a ſin is pardonable, for the firſt motions of Wrath are ſo violent in themſelves, that they are not in the power of a Man to give a ſtop unto them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is in ſome capacity of pardon.</hi>

                  <hi>No, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>for although his Children and all his poſterity had born the infamy of the Mothers fault, he ought not to have killed her, for after that his firſt and greateſt choler was paſſed over, we find that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with her as if ſhe had never given any occaſion of offence, and as if that all thought thereof was quite blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of his Memory. Do you believe, ſaid</hi> Saffre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, <hi>that he was pacified, becauſe he did diſſemble his choler? For my ſelf I do believe, that on the laſt day wherein he made that ſalad, he was the ſame Man as he was in the firſt, when he found her in incontinency, although there are ſome, the firſt motions of whoſe choler have no reſpite at all, until they have put their paſſion into act. And you do me a great pleaſure, to affirm that the Divines do hold ſuch ſins are eaſie to be pardoned, for I am of the ſame opinion with them. We ought to take good heed, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>what we do ſpeak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch dangerous perſons as you are; that which I have ſaid, is to be underſtood when the paſſion is ſo ſtrong, that it ſuddenly doth ſo ſeize upon the ſenſe, that there is no place left for Reaſon. So, ſo, ſaid</hi> Saffre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, <hi>I reſt my ſelf well ſatisfied with what you ſay, and will conclude by it, That a man violently amorous doth more eaſily deſerve pardon, than any other who doth ſin being not in love; for if Love doth lay him bound in chains, Reaſon cannot eaſily command him, and, if We will confeſs the truth, there is not here preſent any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

He is to be commended, who for the love of Virtue only doth do a virtuous work, as, I hope, I ſhall make apparent to you by the patience, and the virtue of a young Lady, who in her good work ſought after nothing but the honour only of God, and the ſalvation of her Husband.</hi>

               <p>THere was a Lady of an Illuſtrious Family in this Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Name I will conceal, ſo wiſe ſhe was, and virtuous, that ſhe was beloved and honoured of all her Neighbors. Her Husband, as he ought to do, did truſt her with all his affairs, which ſo wiſely ſhe did manage, that by her means, her Houſe became one of the richeſt, and moſt accommodated with the beſt moveables that was in all the Countrey of <hi>Anjou</hi> or <hi>Tourain.</hi> Having lived a long time with her Husband, by whom ſhe had many goodly Children, her happineſs (after which a contray doth always follow) did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to diminiſh; wherefore her Husband, being weary with his caſe, and great contentment, did ſeek out both his travel and his torment, and made it his cuſtom, as ſoon as ever his Wife was aſleep, to riſe from her, and to return no more unto her, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:119929:180"/>it was near unto the morning. His Wife did take this manner of life of his ſo much to heart, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a great jeaſouſie, (although ſhe would make no apparence of it) ſhe did neglect all her houſhold affairs, as alſo her ſelf, and her children, being one who believed ſhe had loſt all the fruit of her labours, when ſhe had loſt the love of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to continue which love, there was no labour which ſhe would not willingly endure. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt that, ſhe was ſo careleſſe of all the reſt, that ſhe ſoon perceived the great loſſe which her Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence had occaſioned; For on the one ſide, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>er Husband did carry himſelf without order, and on the other ſide, ſhe looked no more to the affairs of the houſe: inſomuch that the whole Houſe was ſo diſordered, that all things did run confuſedly into Ruine.</p>
               <p>Some of her Kinred, who undrſtood her Diſeaſe, did repreſent unto her the fault ſhe did commit, and did advertiſe her, If the love to her Husband could not perſwade her to look unto the profit of her Houſe, at leaſt the regard of her Children ſhould enforce her. The Compaſſion which ſhe had on them, did at the laſt cauſe her to pluck up her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and by all means to attempt to regain the love of her Husband. On the night following ſhe wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched when he did riſe from her, and immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her was gone, ſhe roſe alſo, and putting on her Night-Gown, ſhe cauſed her Bed to be made, and reading her <hi>Houres</hi> ſhe attended the return of her Husband; when her Husband was come into the Chamber, ſhe did go directly to him to kiſſe him, and brought him a Baſon of water to waſh his hands. He being amazed at this unaccuſtomed complement, did aſſure her, that he came only from caſting up ſome accounts, and for that, there was no need that he ſhould waſh at all. She made anſwer to him, That although it was no great matter of Neceſſity, yet it was Civility to waſh his hands when he came
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:119929:181"/>from a filthy and polluted place; Belike, deſiring by this to prompt him to underſtand and to hate his wicked life: But he did not reform himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Wife for a whole year did continue this Cuſtome.</p>
               <p>When ſhe perceived that it was uneffectual, one morning attending the return of her Husband, who ſtayed longer than he was accuſtomed, ſhe had a great deſire to ſeek him out, and did goe ſo long from Chamber to Chamber, that ſhe found him at laſt aſleep in the hindermoſt Wardope with one of the moſt unſightly and deformed Maids that was in all the houſe; whereupon ſhe reſolved to teach him what it was to forſake an honeſt woman for ſo ſoul a ſlut. In this humour ſhe took ſtraw, and did ſet it on fire in the middle of the Chamber, and when ſhe perceived that the ſmoak had almoſt killed her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and enforced him to awake, ſhe took him by the arm and cryed out, Fier, Fier: If her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band were amazed and aſhamed to be taken by his fair Wife with ſo foul and ſo naſty a Creature, he had good reaſon for it. His Wife ſaid unto him, Sir, I have endeavoured one whole year to withdraw you from this looſe life with gentleneſſe and patience, and to ſhew you, that by waſhing without, you ought to purge what was unclean within, But when I perceived that whatſoever I could doe did prevail nothing, I attempted to aſſiſt my ſelf with that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement which commonly doth put an end to all things, aſſuring you Sir, that if this at this preſent ſhould not correct you, I know not, if I ſhall be ſo patient the ſecond time to pluck you from this danger, as I now have done. I muſt beſeech you to conſider that there is no greater diſpair than what proceeds from love, and if I had not God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my eyes, I had not known that patience which I have uſed. Her Husband being very glad that he was eſcaped ſo well, did faithfully promiſe to give her no more occaſion to torment her ſelf, which
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:119929:181"/>the Lady very willingly believed, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of her Husband did immediately turn out of doors that party which did diſcontent her. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hour they did live together in great love, inſomuch that the faults committed and paſſed, in regard of the comfortable life which they now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, was an augmentation of their content.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, I muſt intreat you, if God ſhould give you ſuch Husbands, that you would not despair of them, until you have a long time aſſayed all the means that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly you can to reduce them; for there are four and twenty hours in the day, in the which a man might change his opinion, and a woman ought to conceive her ſelf more happy to have gained her Husband by her own patience and expectation, than if Fortune or her friends had offered her a more ready way. Behold here an example, ſaid</hi> Oyfilla, <hi>which ought to be of great uſe to all married women. Let her take the example who hath a mind to it, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>it is impoſſible for me to have ſo much patience, for though in all eſtates patience he a great virtue, yet I am of opinion, that in marriage it doth lead unto Enmity; for in ſuffering an in jury from an equal, we are thereby conſtrained to ſeparate our ſelves from him as far as poſſibly we can, and in this ſeparation there proceedeth an undervaluing of the fault of being diſloyal, and in that undervaluing by little and little love doth diminiſh, for ſo long we doe love a thing, as we do eſteem the value of it. But it is much to be feared, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient wife may find a ſurious Husband, who inſtead of patience may give her ſorrow. And what can a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band doe ſaid</hi> Parlament <hi>more than this of whom you have had an account in this laſt Hiſtory? What, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite? <hi>why he may beat her ſoundly, until her bones ratile again in her skin, and make her lie in the Truckle bed, and her whom he loved in the High bed. I doe believe, ſaid</hi> Parlament <hi>that a Woman of worth will not take it ſo ill to be beaten by her Husband in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as to be undervalued by him for one who is not to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:119929:182"/>be compared to her, and having endured the puniſhment of the ſeparation of his love, the Husband cannot doe any thing which can put his wife to a greater ſorrow, or can make him to care leſſe for him, for ſo ſaith the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that the pains ſhe took to recall him, was for the love only which ſhe did hear unto her Children, and I doe believe it. And doe you find any great patience in this woman, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>to put fire under the bed where her Husband was afleep? Yes, ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>for when ever ſhe ſaw the ſmoak about him, ſhe awaked him, and peradventure it was in that only that ſhe committed the greateſt fault, for to ſuch Husbands Fire and Cinders are the beſt admonitions.</hi> Longaren, <hi>you are too cruel, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>you have not ſo lived with your Husband. No, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>for God be praiſed, I had no ſuch occaſion, but inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of him, I ſhall grieve all the remnant of my life that I have loſt him. But if you had ſuch a Husband, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide? <hi>what would you have done with him? I doe believe, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that I ſhould not have loved him ſo well, but that I ſhould have killed him firſt, and afterwards my ſelf, for to die after ſuch a vengeance had been a thing more agreeable unto me, than to live loyal with one that is diſloyal. For ought that I can ſee, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>you only love your Husbands for your ſelves, if they are good according to your deſire you doe love them, but if they commit the leaſt fault in the world, they have loſt the labour of all their week for one</hi> Saturday; <hi>And this is the reaſon that you will be Miſtreſſes, but for my part, I am reſolved, and if all Husbands would be but of my mind — It is reaſon, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that the man ſhould goveru us as our Head, but not that he ſhould forſake us, or intreat us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Her Dame deſired to ſee the Bed and the Chamber in which her Husband, being there, was accuſtomed to lodge, which ſhe found, ſo cold, ſo dampiſh, and ſo muſty, that ſhe had great Compaſſion on him; wherefore immediately ſhe did ſend for a good Bed, and Curtains and Valance correſpondent to it, as alſo for pillows, ſheets, and coverlets.

               <p>Her Husband being all this while at <hi>Tours,</hi> and not knowing what his Wife had done, thought long to return unto his Dairy (as he had been accuſtomed to do) whither being come, he much wondred to ſee all things there in ſo good order, and much mote when the Maid did give him Wine to drink in a great Bowl of Silver. He demanded of her, How ſhe came by thoſe Goods?

For he who hath ſaid that he is come to cure the ſick, and not thoſe who are ſound, is come by the law of his Mercy to help our inſirmities, and to break the arreſts of the rigor of his Juſtice, and he who doth think himſelf wiſe, is a fool before the face of God. But to end our Sermon, to whom will</hi> Longeren <hi>give her voice. I doe give it, ſaid he, to</hi> Saffredant. <hi>I hope then, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>to ſhew you by example, that God doth not favour Lovers; For (Ladies) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it hath been heretofore affirmed, that the Vice of Love is common both to Women and to men, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and the artifice is always more ready in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man than in a man, as I ſhall demonſtrate to you by this example.</hi>

               <p>A Lord of <hi>Grignaux</hi> who was a Cavalier of Honour to <hi>Anne</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and Dutcheſſe of <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,</hi> returning to his houſe, from whence he had been abſent two years and more, did find his Wife removed to another place, and not in the Caſtle where he left her, and enquiring of the occaſion, it was told him, that the Caſtle was haunted with a
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:119929:184"/>Spirit which did ſo torment them that none could endure to ſtay in it. Monſieur <hi>de Grignaux</hi> who was not afraid of Hobgoblins made anſwer, that if it was the Devil himſelf he was reſolved to ſee what it was, and took his Wife with him. All the night he burned great Candles to diſcover the Spirit more plainly, and having kept himſelf a long time awake and heard nothing at all, he fell aſleep.</p>
               <p>But immediately he was awaked by a great blow that was given him on his cheek, and he heard a voice crying <hi>Revigne, Revigne,</hi> which was the name of his Grand-mother. He therefore called to his Wife who was in bed with him to light more Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, for the others were all burned out, but ſhe durſt not riſe. Not long after Signior <hi>Grignaux</hi> did plainly perceive that ſomething was drawing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Coverlet from him, and he heard a great noiſe of Tables, and Trenchers, and Diſhes that did fall down in the Chamber, which did continue until the break of day. The Signior was more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that he had loſt his Reſt, than ſurprized with any fear of the Spirit. On the night following he did reſolve with himſelf to take hold of the Spirit, and not long after he was in bed he counterfeited as if he had ſuorted extremely, &amp; did keep his hand open cloſe unto his face. Having in this manner attended the Spirit, he at laſt perceived ſomething to come near him. wherefore he did begin to ſnort as loudly as he did before; and the Spirit growing too ſaucy with him, did give him a good ſound blow on the face. Signior <hi>Grignaux</hi> having his hand prepared, did immediatly take faſt hold on the hand that ſtruck him, and cryed out to his Wife, I have the Spirit by the hand, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diarely did riſe, and bringing the Candle more near unto him, they did find that it was their Chamber-maid who did lie in their own Chamber, who trembling down upon her knees did demand pardon, and promiſed to confeſſe the truth unto
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:119929:185"/>them, which was, that the Love which ſhe had born for a long time to one of his Servants in the Caſtle, did tempt her to undertake this goodly myſtery to drive both Maſter and Miſtreſſe from thence, to the end that they two (to whom the whole charge of the Houſe was committed) might have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to make better chear, which they did when they were alone by themſelves. Monſieur <hi>de Grig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naux,</hi> who was a blunt and a rough man, did command that they ſhould both be puniſhed with ſtripes, and be taught to remember the ill Spirit as long as they lived, which being done accordingly, they were both diſcharged the Caſtle, and by this means the Houſe was deliverd from all trouble of thoſe evil Spirits, which before (for two years together) had played their pranks in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, It is a ſtrange thing to conſider of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful effects of the puiſſant God of Love, who taking all fear from women, doth prompt them to endure all tryals to arrive to the end of their own Deſires. And as this Invention in the Chambermaid was to be blamed, ſo the good understanding of her Maſter is to be commended, who knew very well, that a Spirit goes forth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns no more. Truly, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>Love at this time did not favour the Groom, not the Chambermaid, but ſeems to confeſſe, that the good Underſtanding of the Maſter was more effectual. Howſoever, ſaid</hi> Emarfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, <hi>the Chambermaid by this Invention did live a long time wholly at her own pleaſure. Wicked is that Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and moſt Unhappy, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>which is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon Sin, and doth end in ſhame and puniſhment. It is true, Madam, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>but many people take pains and grief enough to live uprightly, and in all their lives have not ſo much ſenſe of pleaſure, as theſe two in this Account. I am of that opinion, ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla, <hi>that without peace of Conſcience, it is impoſſible to have any perfect pleaſure. Say you ſo, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>the</hi> Italian <hi>hath a Proverb, That the greater the ſin is, it is always the more pleaſant. Truly, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla,

               <head>The Excellent Relation of a Lord who cauſed his Brother-in-law to be put to death, not knowing the nearneſs of the Allyance.</head>
               <head type="sub">The tenth Novell.</head>
               <p>THe Lord who was the Father of <hi>Rolandine,</hi> had many Siſters, ſome whereof were married ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry richly, others of them were Religious Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and one of them who lived in his own houſe was beyond compariſon more beautifull than the reſt. Her Brother did love her ſo intirely, that he preferred her above his Wife and Children. She was demanded in Marriage by many gallant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, but becauſe he would not have her remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from him, or, peradventure, becauſe he loved his wealth too well, he would not ſeem to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, which was the Cauſe that ſhe lived the greateſt part of her age unmarried, leading a moſt virtuous life in her Brothers Houſe; in which there was bred up with her a gallant young Gentleman, who as he increaſed in age, ſo he increaſed in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:119929:186"/>and was ſo eſteemed for his virtue, that he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned all things in his Maſters houſe, inſomuch that when he deſired his Siſter to doe any thing, he imployed this Gentleman to deliver his mind unto her. This authority was the occaſion of a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, which by ſending him both early and late unto her, was by their dayly frequentation much increaſed. But the young Lady fearing her Honour, and the Gentleman his life, if he ſhould offend his Maſter, they received no other pleaſure by their love, but only the content to converſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>At the laſt her Brother told her how much he was obliged to this young Guntleman, who was in the ſame houſe with her, and that he never ſaw any man whom he deſired more to his Brother in law than this Gentleman. He ſo often expreſſed theſe words unto her, that ſhe having communicated them to this Gentleman, they preſumed, that if they ſhould marry, he would give them an eaſie pardon: And Love which willingly believeth that which it deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, did prompt them to conceive, that if they ſhould marry, nothing but good would come of it. In this aſſurance therefore they did conclude and accompliſh their marriage, there being no man that knew of it but the Prieſt only, and ſome few Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And having lived certain years in that pleaſure which a married man and woman ought mutually to enjoy, as being the moſt accompliſhed couple at that time, and the trueſt Lovers that were in Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, Fortune envying to behold two perſons to live in ſo great a happineſſe, would not vouchſafe to grant a continuance to it, but ſtirred up an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to them, who obſerving this Lady did take notice of her great happineſſe, not knowing of her marriage; Whereupon ſhe came unto her Brother, and informed him, that this Gentleman in whom he repoſed ſo great a truſt had recourſe too often to his Siſter in her Chamber, and in ſuch hours
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:119929:186"/>when entrance ought not to be admitted.</p>
               <p>This report was not believed the firſt time (ſo much he truſted to his Siſter and this Gentleman) but the woman brought in againſt them ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, pretending that it was for the honour ſhe did bear unto his houſe, that he ſo narowly did watch them, that theſe two parties thinking no ill, were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized faſt aſleep in one anothers Arms. Her Brother having one Evening received advertiſement that the Gentleman was gone into his Siſters Chamber, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly repaired thither, and found them both blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with love, and aſleep together. The indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which poſſeſſed him at the ſight thereof, did take away the utterance of his words, and drawing his ſword he did run after the Gentleman to kill him, but he being very nimble of body did fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in his ſhirt, and being not able to eſcape out of the door did leap out of the window into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. The poor Lady his Siſter being in her ſmock did on both her knees kneel down to her Brother, and ſaid unto him, Sir, Save the life of my Husband, for I am eſpouſed to him, and if he hath offended, puniſh me only, for what he hath done hath been at my requeſt. Her Brother being outragious made no anſwer at all, but only ſaid; And if he were your Husband a hundred thouſand times, yet will I puniſh him as an unfaithfull Servant, who hath both deceived and diſgraced me; And ſpeaking thoſe words he did put his head out of the Window, and commanded aloud, that they ſhould kill him without mercy, which was ſuddenly put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before his own eyes and his Siſters, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding this lamentable ſpectacle, which no pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of hers could remedy, did talk unto her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a woman out of her ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Brother (ſaid ſhe) I have neither Father nor Mother alive, and I am at that age, that I may marry whom I will at my own pleaſure, I have choſen that Gentleman concerning whom you your
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:119929:187"/>ſelf have oftentimes ſpoke unto me, and aſſured me that it was your deſire that I ſhould marry him, and for my obedience to your Counſel, (although for what I have done, I could juſtifie my ſelf by Law without you) you have killed that Man, whom you your ſelf loved the beſt in all the world. Since it is ſo that my prayers could not preſerve him from Death, I do beſeech you by all the love that you have born unto me, that at this preſent you will make me the Companion of his Death, as I have been in the fortunes of his Life. Doing this, you ſhall both ſatisfie your cruel, and moſt unjuſt choler, and give reſt unto her Soul and Body, who neither can, nor will live without him.</p>
               <p>Her Brother, notwithſtanding he was ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that he had even loſt all Reaſon, yet he was touched with ſuch a compaſſion at his Siſters words, that, without granting or denying her Requeſt, he did leave her alone to her ſelf; and having conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what he had done, and underſtood in earneſt that the Gentleman had married his Siſter, he wiſhed with all his heart that he had never commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo raſh a deed, and he was poſſeſſed with ſo ſtrong a fear, that his Siſter would demand either Juſtice or Vengeance, that he cauſed a great Caſtle to be builded in the midſt of a Foreſt, into which he did put her, and did forbid that any one ſhould ſpeak unto her. Some years afterwards, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his Conſcience, he did aſſay to gain her, and did imploy ſome perſons of truſt to commune with her concerning a ſecond Marriage; but ſhe ſent him word, That he had given her already ſo bad a Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that ſhe would have no Supper of ſuch Viands again; and that ſhe reſolved to live in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he ſhould not be the Butcher of her ſecond Husband: for ſhe could hardly be induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he would pardon another, having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſo mercileſſe to him, whom he loved beſt in the world. And although ſhe was but weak, and
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:119929:187"/>unable to revenge her own Cauſe, yet her Hope was in HIM, who is the true Judge, and who will ſuffer no Sin to paſſe unpuniſhed, to whoſe only love ſhe would devote her ſelf, during her life in that Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage, which ſhe did accordingly, for ſhe never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence until the day of her Death, untill her Soul departed from her Body, living with ſuch patience and auſterity, that after her Death every one did run thither, as to the Seat of a Saint; and ſo great a Ruine did fall upon her Brothers Houſe, that of ſix Sons which he had, not one remained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, but all of them dyed moſt miſerably, and in the end the Inheritance was devolved (as you heard in my other Account) upon his Daughter <hi>Rol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, I pray to God, that this Example may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to you, that none of you may have a deſire to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for your own pleaſure, without the conſent of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o whom you do ow obedience; for Marriage is an Eſtate of ſo long a Continuance, that it ought not lightly to be undertaken, nor without the Conſent of our beſt Friends and Kinred. And it cannot at the beſt be ſo well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but it will undoubtedly bring with i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as much pain as pleaſure. In good faith, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>if there were neither God, nor Law, to teach fools to be wiſe, this Example is ſufficient enough to inſtruct them to bear more reverence to their Parents, and Kinred, than to marry at their own pleaſure. Madam, It is ſo, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>that ſhe who hath one good day in a year, is not unfortunate throughout all her life. She had a long time the pleaſure to ſee, and to diſcourſe with him whom ſhe loved better than ſhe loved her ſelf, and after that, ſhe had the delight of the Marriage-bed, without any trouble, or remorſe of Conſcience. And I eſteem that Contentment to be ſo great, that, it ſeems to me, it doth exceed the ſorrow it brought with it. You will ſay then, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>that Women do receive more pleaſures to ly with their Husbands, than they do receive grief to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:119929:188"/>to ſee them killed before their eyes. That is not my in tention (ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>for I ſhould then ſpeak againſt the Experience which I have of married Women, but I conceive that ſo great and extraordinary a pleaſure as to marry that man whom we love beſt in the world, is more greatly to be eſteemed, than to loſe him by death which is a common calamity. So it is, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>if it were by a natural death, but this here spoken of was too cruel, for it is very ſtrange to me, ſeeing this Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior was neither her Father, nor her Husband, but her Brother only, and moreover that ſhe was of full age, and that the Laws doe permit the Daughters to marry whom they pleaſe, how he durſt execute ſuch a cruelty. I do find it not ſtrange at all, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>for he kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not his Siſter whom ſo perfectly he did love, but the young Gentleman whom he cheriſhed and brought up as his own Son, and loved as his own Brother, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving preferred him, and inriched him in his Service, the Gentleman ought to have been content, and not to have ſought his Siſter in marriage, which nothing at all did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto him. The Honour and pleaſure, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>is not uſual for a Gentleman who is but a Servant to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Lady of ſo great a Family; And if the death be ſtrange, the pleaſure muſt be new alſo, and ſo much the greater that it hath the opinion of all wiſe men to affirm it, and the contentment of a heart full of love to aid it, and the repoſe of the Soul to attend it, which is a quiet Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſeeing God is not offended with it. And as for that death which you ſay was cruel, it ſeems to me, that it being inevitable, the speedieſt death is the best, for we all know that of neceſſity we muſt paſſe through Nature to eternity: And I eſteem them moſt happy who ſtay not any long time in the Suburbs; and from the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity (which only in this world can be ſo called) do in an instaet fly unto that which is eternal. What do you call the Suburbs of death, ſaid</hi> Simontault? <hi>Thoſe, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide <hi>who have had many tribulations in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thoſe who have been a long time ſick, thoſe who by the extremity of corporal or Spiritual griefs are come
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:119929:188"/>ſo far as to deſpiſe death, and to complain that their laſt hour comes too ſlowly: Theſe are they who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready paſſed through the Suburbs of Death, and have lodged in thoſe Inns in which there is more noiſe than reſt. It was impoſſible but that this Lady muſt loſe her Husband by death, but in loſing him by the choler of her Brother, being exempted from ſeeing him ſick, or bedrid, and exchanging the joy ſhe had to be with him, into the love and the ſervice of God, ſhe might well call her ſelf happy. Do you make no reckoning, ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>of the diſgrace which ſhe received, and of her tedious impriſonment? I do believe, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>that a Man or Woman who abſolutely doe love according to the Commandment of God, do know neither ſhame nor diſhonour, but when they alter or diminiſh from the perfection of their love, for the glory to love truly doth not know, nor is it capable of diſgrace; And as for the impriſonment of the Body, I do believe this Lady had ſuch an inlargement of her Soul, which was united to God, and to her Husband, that ſhe was hardly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble where ſhe was, but eſteemed her ſolitude to be the greateſt liberty; for they who cannot behold that which they love, have no other happineſſe but inceſſantly to think upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; And that confinement is never ſtreight where the Soul is free, and the thoughts can exerciſe themſelves at their own preaſure. There is nothing more true, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>than that which</hi> Nomer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide <hi>doth declare, but he who by his fury made that ſeparation may truly be called guilty and unhappy, for he at one and the ſame time offended both God, and Love, and Honour. In good earneſt, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>I do much wonder at the different loves of women, and do well obſerve that thoſe who have the moſt love, have the moſt virtue, and that thoſe who have the leaſt do indeavour by diſſimulation to counterfeit themſelves to be virtuous. It is true, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that a Heart honeſt to God and Men doth love more ſincerely than that which is vicious, for it feareth not that we may ſound the depth of its intention. I have often heard
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:119929:189"/>it affirmed, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that Men ought not to be reproved when they purchaſe the love of Women; for God hath planted in the hearts of Men, Love, and Boldneſs to demand them, and in the hearts of Women, Fear, and Chaſtity to refuſe them. If Man ſhould be puniſhed for uſing the faculties which are given to him, he ſhould ſuffer wrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this ſeemeth ſtrange to me, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that he had ſo often praiſed him to his Siſter; for it would appear great folly or cruelty in any one who keeps a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to praiſe the clearneſs of the water to one that looks upon it, and is languiſhing for thirst, and then to kill him if he offers to take any of it to drink. Without all doubt, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>the fire was the occaſion that did kindle the fire by the temptation of his words, which he ought not to have extinguiſhed with the edge of his ſword. And why ſhould it ſo heinouſly be rendred, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>that an ordinary Gentleman, uſing no other force, but ſervice, ſhould come to marry a Lady of ſo great a Family, ſeeing the Philoſophers do affirm, That the leaſt, and moſt inconſiderable man in the world, is worth more than the greateſt, and the moſt virtuous Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? The reaſon is, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>That to eſtabliſh the Publique peace, the Degrees of Families, the Ages of perſons, and the Ordinances of Laws, are altogether loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon, without weighing the Love, and the Virtues of Men, that ſo there may be no confuſion in the State; and from hence it doth proceed, that the Marriages which are made amongſt equals, and according to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Conſent of Friends and Kinred, do differ oftentimes ſo much in heart, complexion, and condition, that inſtead of entring into a ſtate that leads unto Safety, they are brought into the Suburbs of Hell. And it is as much to be obſerved, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>that thoſe who marry only for pure love, having hearts, conditions, and complexions alike, without any reflection at all on the differences of Houſes and Deſcents, are not left without repentance; for this great and indiſcreet Love, doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes turn it ſelf into Jealouſte and Fury. In my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:119929:189"/>ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>neither the one nor the other is commendable, but thoſe only are to be praiſed who ſubmit themſelves to the will of God, and look not either upon Glory, Avarice, or Pleaſure, but only upon a virtuous love, and by a mutual Conſent do deſire to live in the ſtate of Marriage, as God and Nature have ordained. And although there is no Eſtate without ſome tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet I have ſeen theſe to live without Repentance, and we are not all ſo unhappy in this Company, but ſome of us who are married, are in this number. Thereupon,</hi> Hircan, Saffredant, Guebron, <hi>and</hi> Simontault, <hi>did all ſwear that they were married in the like reſolutions, and that they never repented of their Marriages. But whatſoever the Truth herein was, they whom this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerned were ſo much contented, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould hear any thing that was more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, they did all riſe from Ground to give praiſe and thanks unto God, and found the Monks ready to begin Veſpers. The Service being ended, they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Supper, the whole Subject of their Diſcourſe being concerning their Marriages, which continued all that Evening, repeating the Fortunes they incountered during the time of their wooing, and the Joys of their Bridal Days; but becauſe one interrupted the Diſcourſe of the other, I cannot give you a particular Account of it, which was no leſſe pleaſant to deſcribe than was their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the Meadow: but ſure enough it is that they did take great delight therein, and had no other Conference til the hour was come in which they were accuſtomed to go to bed, which did ſteal upon them ſooner than they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But Madam</hi> Oyſilla <hi>finding that it was high time to retire her ſelf, did give occaſion to the whole Company to do the like, every one being much joyed in his own particular, but eſpecially the marryed, who that night did not ſleep at all, but having spent the firſt part thereof in the Accounts of their paſt love, they imployed the remainder in the Demonſtration of their preſent; And thus pleaſantly this Night did paſs away until the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>

            <p>VVHen the Morning was come, Madam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> did prepare for them their ſpiritual Breakfaſt, which was of ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a relliſh, that it was able to fortifie both the Body and the Soul, and the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was ſo much pleaſed, that it ſeemed to them they never heard a Sermon which did profit more. And when they heard the Bell to tole unto the Maſſe, they reſorted all together to it, exerciſing their contemplations in the way on the holy Inſtructions which they had received. Maſſe being heard, having walked a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, they did ſit down to dinner, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to themſelves that the Account of that preſent day ſhould be as pleaſant as were the Diſcourſes of the dayes before. <hi>Saffredant</hi> ſaid unto them, he could wiſh that the bridge might be a whole moneth in building, ſo great was the pleaſure he received in this gallant
<pb facs="tcp:119929:190"/>Company. But the Abbot within cauſed all poſsible diligence to be made, becauſe it was not for his advantage to have ſo many honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonages in his Abby, whoſe preſence detained his accuſtomed Pilgrims from going ſo often as before to viſit the holy places. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving repoſed themſelves a little after dinner, they returned to their paſtime in the Meadow, and every one of them having taken their ſeat, they demanded of <hi>Parlament</hi> to whom ſhe would give her voice. It appears to me, ſaid ſhe, that <hi>Saffredant</hi> ſhould do well to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this Journal, for I doe already perceive by him, that he hath not a countenance that would make us weep. Ladies, ſaid <hi>Saffredant,</hi> you may think what you pleaſe, but beſhrew me you will ſhew your ſelves cruel enough if you ſhould not take pity on the poor Frier whoſe Hiſtory I ſhal account unto you, and although his Deſign was prevented by the virtue of a chaſt Lady, ſuch as are amongſt us, yet you may imagine what doth become of thoſe poor maids whom the deſire of the Act hath made without fear to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Enterpriſe. To ſhew therefore unto you that the blindneſs of concupiſcence doth take away all fear and prudent conſideration, I will in this place give you an account of a Frier in <hi>Flanders.</hi>

The Warden of the Friers did make choice of the moſt worthy in his Covent to perform this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in regard of the great benefits he had received from the Houſe of <hi>Aiguemont,</hi> and that of <hi>Pienne,</hi> of which this Lady was; and being more deſirous than all others to gain the good Eſteem and the Love of great Houſes, he did ſend the moſt remarkable Preacher which he had in the whole Covent, who the <hi>Advent</hi> did his duty very well, and gave the Counteſſe great Content. The time being come, in which the Counteſſe would receive her Creator, ſhe did ſend for her Confeſſor, and was confeſſed in her Chapel, the door being locked, that the Confeſſion might be the more private; which being ended, ſhe reſign'd her place to her Dame of Honor, who being confeſſed, did ſend her Daughter to paſſe under the hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:119929:192"/>and our holy Mother the Church doth ordain? I do uſe Confeſſion (ſaid the young Gentlewoman) as the Church doth command me, and would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe penance, and receive abſolution, but I would not that you ſhould put your hands upon my naked body, for in that manner I ſhall refuſe your penance. Then (ſaid the Confeſſor) I can never give you abſolution. On theſe words the Damoſel did riſe from her knees, having her Conſcience much troubled, for ſhe was ſo young, that ſhe was afraid ſhe had ſinned in refuſing to doe what her Confeſſor had enjoyned her.</p>
               <p>The Counteſſe of <hi>Aiguemont</hi> having received <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Domini,</hi> her Dame of Honour deſiring to be made partaker of it after her, did demand of her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if ſhe were ready; her Daughter weeping made anſwer, No, for ſhe was not yet confeſſed; and what did you ſo long then with the Preacher, ſaid the Mother? her Daughter made anſwer, nothing at all, for refuſing the penance which he impoſed upon me, he refuſed alſo to give me abſolution. Her Mother ſo diſcretly enquired of her what penance it was, that at the laſt ſhe underſtood the whole manner of it, and cauſing her to confeſſe unto another they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Euchariſt both together.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Counteſſe was returned from the Church, her Dame of Honour did complain unto her of the Preacher, at which ſhe was poſſeſſed with equal ſorrow and amazement, having before enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a very good opinion of him. The novelty of the penance did turn her anger into laughter, but her laughter did put on that authority as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Frier to be taken and beaten in her kitchin, where by the force of Rods he confeſſed the Truth, and being tyed hand and foot, ſhe ſent him afterwards to the Warden of the Covent, deſiring him that for the time to come he would ſend more honeſt men to preach unto her the Word of God.</p>

And what of all this, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>Do you think that Friers are not men, and to be excuſed as well as we, eſpecially this Frier, who in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſaw himſelf all alone with ſo fair a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman? Certainly, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>if he had thought on the Nativity of Jeſus Chriſt, which was at that time repreſented, he could not have had ſo wicked a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. You do not obſerve his method, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>for he would begin with the Incarnation, before he did come to the Nativity. Nevertheleſſe he was faulty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, ſeeing upon ſo high a day, and on ſo fair a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he would have committed ſo foul a ſin. In my opinion, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>the Counteſſe did give him ſuch a puniſhment, that his Companions may take Example by it. But it is worth your obſervation, ſaid</hi> Nomerfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, <hi>if ſhe did well, to bring a Scandal upon him, and if it had not been better that ſhe had privatly reproved him, than thus openly to have divulged his fault.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>I do believe, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>it had been indeed the beſt Courſe, for we are commanded to reprove our Neighbour in private, before we do declare his faults to any, or to the Church it ſelf; for when a Man is become once ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he is not, without great difficulty, brought to amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and I am of opinion, that it is Shame, as much as Conſcience, that retireth many Men from Sin. We
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:119929:193"/>muſt therefore, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>practiſe that Counſel of the Goſpel to one another, but not to thoſe who preach one thing, and who do another, for we ought not to be afraid to ſcandalize thoſe who do ſcandalize others. And it ſeems to me to be a meritorious work, to make them to underſtand themſelves to be ſuch as they are, that we may take heed of their ſeducings, and teach young Maids to do ſo too, who are not alwayes ſo well adviſed. But to whom will</hi> Hircan <hi>give his voice? Becauſe you do ask me, I will give it to your ſelf, ſaid</hi> Hircan. <hi>Since you give it unto me, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>I will give you an Account of one, concerning whom I my ſelf may ſerve for Witneſſe, and I have often heard it affirmed, that how much the more that Virtue in a weak and ſeeble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is aſſaul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

To underſtand aright the perſons of whom I am to ſpeak, I ſhall, peradventure, do ſome little wrong to the truth, as alſo that I ſhall cloath their ſtory in ſo poor a Dreſſe, that none will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it; Howſoever the Accompliſhments of the young Maid, by whom ſuch worthy things were done, do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force me to declare them.</hi>

               <p>IN one of the greateſt Towns of <hi>Tourain</hi> there did dwell a Lord of a great and honourable houſe, who
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:119929:193"/>had there his education from his Infancy. I will make no mention in this place, of the perfections, the grace, and beauty, and the great virtues of this young Prince, I ſhall only exhibite to you, that <hi>France</hi> had not his equal. Being at fifteen years of age, he took more pleaſure to ride and to hunt, than to behold the beauties of Ladies. One day when he was at Church he fixed his eyes upon a young Maid, who in her Infancy had been brought up in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle where he lived, and after the death of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her Father did remove to another place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe did goe to <hi>Poictou</hi> with her Brother. This Maid whoſe name was <hi>Frances,</hi> had a Baſtard Siſter whom her Father loved very well, and married her to the chief Butler of this young Prince, who did eſteem as well of her as of any in his Houſe. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died and left unto <hi>Frances</hi> for her portion all the demeans and houſes which he had in this great Town. Wherefore after her Fathers death ſhe removed from <hi>Poictou</hi> unto this place where her Eſtate was, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was but 16 years of age, &amp; unmarried, ſhe would not live alone in her own houſe, but agreed for her bord with her Siſter who was the Butlers Wife. The young Prince obſerving this Maid to be very lovely, being of a brown hair, but of a clear complexion, and having a carriage that did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend her Eſtate, for ſhe ſeemed rather a Princeſſe than the Daughter of a Citizen, he a long time with a ſtedfaſt eye did look upon her, and being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in love before, did find in his heart an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed heat, and retiring into his Chamber he did enquire after her whom he ſaw in the Church, and remembred that it was ſhe, who in her infancy was accuſtomed to come unto the Caſtle to play with his Siſter, and acquainted his Siſter with it. His Siſter did ſend for her, and made her very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com, deſiring her, that ſhe would take the pains to come often to her, which ſhe did, as often as there were any Marriages, or publick Meetings, where the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:119929:194"/>young Prince would behold her with ſuch a greedy eye, that he did begin to love her intirely, and becauſe he knew ſhew was but of mean parentage, he hoped eaſily to obtain that which he deſired, but having not the means to ſpeak unto her, he ſent unto her a Gentleman of his Chamber, to ſollicite her for him. But ſhe, who was as wife as ſhe was young, and feared God, did allege unto him that ſhe could not believe that his Maſter, who was ſo gallant and ſo accompliſhed a Prince, would ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue himſelf as to look upon a Creature ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect as her ſelf, eſpecially ſeeing in the Caſtle where he had his reſidence there were ſo many great and beautiful Ladies, ſhe therefore conceived, that what he did ſpeak was from himſelf, and not from the commandment of his Maſter. When the young Prince had underſtood this anſwer, Love which always doth grow more ſtrong where it finds moſt reſiſtance, did make him more hotly to purſue his enterpriſe, Whereupon he did write a Letter to her, deſiring her that ſhe would believe that whatſoever this Meſſenger did ſay unto her did proceed from himſelf. She who very well could both read &amp; write, did read the Letter all over, to which (whatſoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty the Gentleman did make) ſhe would return no anſwer at all, affirming that it did not belong to a Perſon of ſo baſe a condition as her ſelf to write unto ſuch a Prince as he was, but did beſeech him not to ſuppoſe her ſo weak, as to believe that he had ſo good an opinion of her, as to bear any love unto her; and if he thought by reaſon of her poor eſtate to have her at hs pleaſure, he did much deceive himſelf, for ſhe had as honeſt a heart as the greateſt Princeſſe in Chriſtendom, and eſteemed no treaſure in the World comparable to her Honour and her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. She humbly beſought him that he would not hinder her to preſerve that treaſure, for ſhould ſhe die, ſhe would never alter her reſolution.</p>
               <p>The young Prince did not find this anſwer to be
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:119929:194"/>agreeable unto him, nevertheleſſe he continued paſſionately to love her, and failed not every day to be preſent at the Maſſe in that Church to which ſhe repaired, and all the while that Maſſe was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he perpetually addreſſed the Devotion of his eyes to that fair image, which when ſhe perceived, ſhe changed her place, and repaired to another Church, not to avoid the ſight of him (for ſhe had not been a reaſonable creature if ſhe had not taken pleaſure to look upon him) but ſhe was afraid to be ſeen by him, for ſince ſhe conceived her ſelf not worthy to be beloved by him in the way of Honour and Marriage, ſhe would not that it ſhould be by the way of folly and of pleaſure; and whenever ſhe ſaw any place in the Church where ſhe might ſeat her ſelf, the Prince would fit as cloſe by her as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he could, which made her to goe from Church to Church to hear Maſſe dayly, and to the furtheſt Churches that poſſibly ſhe could; and when any great marriages were ſolemnized at the Caſtle, ſhe did forbear to be preſent at them, and although the Siſter of the Prince did invite her, ſhe would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways excuſe her ſelf by ſome indiſpoſition or other.</p>
               <p>The Prince perceiving that he could not have that acceſſe (nor ſpeak unto her) as he deſired, did aid himſelf by his Butler, and promiſed him many great rewards, if he would aſſiſt him in this affair. The Butler did promiſe to doe the utmoſt of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, as well to pleaſe his Maſter, as for the profit which he hoped to receive from him, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day he did give an account unto the Prince of what ſhe both ſaid and did, and that above all things to the utmoſt of her power ſhe did fly all temptations to behold him.</p>
               <p>At the ſaſt, the great Deſire which he had to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his love unto her, did prompt him to an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the accompliſhment thereof, which was to ride on his great Horſe, (he being moſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in that Art) in a publique place of the City
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:119929:195"/>before the houſe of his Butler, where <hi>Frances</hi> lived; and having made his Horſe to tread many Rings, and to riſe aloft into many dangerous Corvetts, where <hi>Frances</hi> might behold him, he did premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately fall from his Horſe into a deep Mire, and ſo eaſily, that he received no hurt at all; howſoever he complained much, and demanded if there were no lodgings thereabouts, that he might change his habiliments? Every one was ready at his Door to preſent their ſervice to him; but ſome that ſtood by, did aſſure him, that his own Butlers houſe was the next, and the beſt, of which he made choice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others.</p>
               <p>He found there a Chamber richly accommodated, and ſtripped himſelf into his ſhirt, for his cloaths were all corered with Mud: When he was in Bed, and obſerved that his Servants were gone from him, to provide him with new habiliments, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for his Hoſt, and Hoſteſſe, and demanded of them where <hi>Frances</hi> was? They had much to do to find her, for as ſoon as ſhe perceived the Prince did enter into the houſe, ſhe did hide her ſelf in the moſt obſcure and unfrequented place thereof. Nevertheleſſe her Siſter found her out, who did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her not to be afraid to hold Diſcourſe with ſuch a Civil, and ſo Virtuous a Prince. How my Siſter, (ſaid <hi>Frances</hi>) Do you, whom I reverence as my Mother, adviſe me to Diſcourſe with a young Lord, whoſe Deſires, you can witneſſe with me, I do know too well? Her Siſter made her ſo many Remonſtrances, and Promiſes, that ſhe would not leave her alone with him, that at the laſt ſhe did go along with her, but with a countenance ſo diſcoloured, ſo wan, and ſpiritleſſe, that it would rather beget Pity, than Concupiſcence. When the Prince beheld her near unto his Bed, he did take her by her hand, which was cold and trembling, and ſaid unto her, <hi>Frances,</hi> Do you eſteem me to be ſo cruel a man, ſo barbarous and devouring, that I
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:119929:195"/>ear up Women when I doe look upon them? Wherefore have you ſo great a fear of him, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth nothing more than your honour and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? You know that in all places that it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to find you, I have ſought you out, only to ſee you, and to ſpeak unto you, and to do me the greateſt ſpite in the world, you have forſaken all thoſe places where I was accuſtomed to ſee you at Maſſe, that I might receive no contentment at all, either by ſeeing you, or by ſpeaking to you; But all this hath ſerved you to no purpoſe, for I have not ceaſed to follow you, and am come hither by the means which you have ſeen, having endanger'd to break my neck by falling willfully from my Horſe, to receive the Contentment onely but to ſpeak to you; Wherefore I intreat you, <hi>Frances,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have put my ſelf into Danger with ſo much inconvenience, that it may not be unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me, and that with my great love I may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe yours. When a long time he attended her anſwer, and beheld that ſhe had tears in her eyes, which were fixed on the ground, drawing her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as cloſe as poſſibly he could, he thought to have kiſſed, and embraced her; but ſhe ſaid unto him, No, Sir, No, That which you ſearch after muſt not be had; for although I am but a Worm of the Earth in compariſon of you, my honour is ſo dear unto me, that I had rather dye, than have it diminiſhed for the greateſt pleaſure in the world, and the fear which I have that thoſe who have ſeen you come into this Houſe, do ſuſpect me to be the cauſe of it, is the occaſion of that great trembling which is upon me, And becauſe it hath pleaſed you to do me ſo great an Honour as to ſpeak unto me, you muſt pardon me, if I make an anſwer to you according as my Honour doth command me; I am not ſo blind (my Lord) either in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or my eys, that I do not perfectly ſee the great Beauty and the Graces with which God hath
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:119929:196"/>indued you, and I do believe that Lady ſhall be the moſt happy Woman in the world, who ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the Body and the Love of ſo accompliſhed a Prince; But to what purpoſe is all this, ſeeing it is not for me to enjoy, nor any Maid of my low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, inſomuch, that but onely the deſire of it ſhould be in me a perfect folly? What may I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the Reaſon which doth cauſe you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe your ſelf to me, but onely that the Ladies of your Court (whom you cannot chuſe but love, if Beauty, and all her Graces are to be loved by you) are ſo virtuous, that you dare not demand that of them, which the ſmallneſſe of my Eſtate doth prompt you unto a hope to receive from me? And I am confident, that when you ſhall enjoy that which you do deſire of ſuch a ſilly Maid as my ſelf, it will ſerve as a ſubject only to you to entertain diſcourſe with your Miſtreſſe, for two long hours and more, in accounting to her your great Victories, to the prejudice and overthrow of a weak and credulous Virgin. But (my Lord) I muſt beſeech you to conſider with your ſelf, that I am not of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; I have been brought up in a Houſe where I have learned what it is to love: My Father and my Mother were your faithfull Servants, wherefore I muſt beſeech you, ſince God hath not made me a Princeſſe, to be eſpouſed to you, nor of Eſtate to be accounted your Miſtreſſe, or your Sweet-heart, that you would not make me your Proſtitute; for I do highly eſteem of your Virtues, and do deſire that you may be the moſt happy of all the Princes in Chriſtendom. And if, for your Recreation, you will have Women of my Eſtate, you may find enough in this City, and (beyond all compariſon) far more handſom than my ſelf, who will not put you to ſo much trouble to intreat them. Addreſſe your ſelf therefore unto thoſe, the purchaſe of whoſe honour may be pleaſing to you, and let her alone, who doth love you better than her ſelf; for if it ſhould ſo fall
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:119929:196"/>out, that either your life or my own ſhould this day be required of God, I ſhould eſteem my ſelf moſt happy to ſacrifiſe my own for the preſervation of yours. It is not for want of love that I doe fly from your Company; but ſomething elſe is lodged in my Conſcience, for my Honour is more dear unto me than my life. If it pleaſe you (my Lord) I will doe the uttermoſt of my indeavour to continue in your good opinion, and through all my life will pray unto God for your health and happineſſe. It is true that the Honour you have done me will make me the more to be eſteemed amongſt People of my condition, but what Man is there (after I have ſeen you) that I ſhall take care to look upon? And by this means my heart ſhall be in a perpetual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but only for the obligation with which it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhall be charged, to pray to God for you, for there is no other ſervice which I can doe you.</p>
               <p>The young Prince obſerving this honeſt anſwer (although it was not according to his deſire) did not eſteem leſſe of her than he did before, and uſed the utmoſt of all his art and eloquence to perſwade her to a belief, that he would never love any other Woman but her ſelf, but ſhe was ſo diſcret, that ſo unreaſonable a thing could never enter into her underſtanding. During this diſcourſe (although it was often repreſented to him, that his Cloaths were brought from the Caſtle) yet he took ſuch a delight to hear her, that he cauſed it to be reported that he was aſleep, until the hour of Supper was come, at which he durſt not but be preſent by reaſon of his Mother who was one of the wiſeſt Ladies in the world. And thus this young Prince departed from the houſe of his Butler, and mote high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than ever eſteemed of the honeſty of this Maid. He oftentimes diſcourſed of her to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that did lie in his Chamber, who conceiting that money would prevail more than love, did coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell him to offer her a round ſum of money to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:119929:197"/>unto his will: But the young Prince whoſe Mother was his Treaſureſſe, had no large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for ſuch petty pleaſures, howſoever he did take up all he could borrow, and made up a ſum of five hundred Crowns, which he did ſend unto her by his Gentleman, deſiring her to alter her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ſhe, when ever ſhe did behold the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, did ſay unto the Gentleman, I pray Sir, tell your Maſter, that I have a heart ſo upright and honeſt, that if I muſt obey him in that which he commands me, the beauties and the graces that are in him had already overcome me to it, but if they have not prevailed upon my honour, all the money in the world can never corrupt me to it; wherefore I pray you to return it back unto him, for I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr an honeſt poverty above all the Goods that can be deſired.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman ſeeing her obſtinateneſſe, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto thoughts of Cruelty, and did proceed ſo far, that he did threaten her with the power, and the Authority of his Maſter. But ſhe ſmiling, did reply unto him, Make thoſe afraid with that who do not underſtand it; for I know well enough that he is ſo wiſe, and ſo virtuous, that ſuch words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed from him; and I am moſt confident that he will diſavow them, when you ſhall repeat them to him: But if it ſhould be as you ſay, there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Torment, nor Death ſo cruel, that ſhall make me to alter my reſolution; for (as I have told you) ſince Love cannot turn my heart, not all the Good, nor all the Evil that in this world can arrive unto me, ſhall ever be able to divert me from the faſtneſs of my Counſels. The Gentleman, who had made a Promiſe to his Maſter that he would gain her for him, did with a marvellous deſpite bring back this anſwer to him, and did perſwade him to uſe all means poſſible to obtain his Deſires of her; telling him, that it was not for his Honour to be denyed by a Maid of her Condition. But the young Prince,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:119929:197"/>who would uſe no other means but what Honeſty did command, fearing alſo the report that might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thereon, if it were brought to his Mothers ear, who being a very auſtere Lady, would be very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him, did not dare to undertake it. But his Gentleman at laſt contrived a way ſo eaſie for him, that he did think he had her already in his Arms; and to put it in execution, he did ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Butler, who, reſolving with himſelf to ſerve his Maſter in any way, whatſoever it were, did one dey deſire his Wife and his Siſter-in-law, to go with him to a Houſe which he had near unto a Foreſt, to ſee his Vineyard there, which they both promiſed to do. When the Day was come, he did acquaint the young Prince with it, who determined with himſelf to go thither, without any Companion at all, but his Gentleman who lodged in his Chamber, and gave order to have his Mule in readineſſe on the appointed hour. But God ſo pleaſed, that on that day his Mother did accouter a marvelous rich Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet which ſhe had made, and to aſſiſt her in it, ſhe had all her Children with her, where, amongſt the reſt, the young Prince was buſied until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour was paſſed; Being with-held by his Mother, the young Prince could not keep his word with his Butler, who had taken his Siſter-in-law on horſeback behind him, and adviſed his Wife to counterfeit her ſelf ſick; ſo that when they were ready to ſet forth, there came one to tell him, that ſhe was fallen ill on the ſudden, and could not go with them.</p>
               <p>When the Butler was at his Farm in the Country, and ſaw that the hour was paſſed in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the young Prince, he ſaid unto his Siſter-in-law, It is in vain to ſtay any longer, we will return from whence we came. His Siſter asked him who it was he ſtayed for? I did expect the young Prince here, (ſaid the Butler) who did promiſe to give me a meeting. When his Siſter-in-law did underſtand
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:119929:198"/>that wickedneſſe, ſhe ſaid unto him, Make no ſtay at all (my Brother) for his occaſions at the Court are ſo importunate, that on this day I doe know he cannot come. Her Brother did believe her, and did ride back to the City with her. When ſhe was come back, ſhe told her Brother in the height of her choler, that he was the Varlet of the Devil, and did more than he was commanded by the Prince, for ſhe was aſſured that this deſign of carrying her abroad was an invention of his own, and of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemans, and not of the Princes, whoſe money he had rather gain to encourage him in his follies, than perform the office of a good Servant; and becauſe ſhe had found him to be ſuch a man, ſhe would ſtay no longer in his houſe, and immediately ſhe depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from her Siſter, and did goe to her own inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</p>
               <p>The chief Butler having failed in his enterpriſe, did repair unto the Caſtle to underſtand the reaſon why the Prince did not come according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and in the way he found him on his Mule, and none with him but the Gentleman in whom ſo much he truſted. The Prince ſaid unto him, what now, is ſhe there? The Butler declared every thing to him according as it fell out. The young Prince was heartily ſorry that he performed not his promiſe, and the rather becauſe he conceived with himſelf, that it was the only and laſt expedient he could uſe. And ſeeing there was no remedy, he did ſeek her out ſo diligently, that at the laſt he did find her in a company and place where ſhe could not avoid him, and he did chide her much for her harſh and rigorous uſage of him, and for her leaving of her Brorhers houſe. She made anſwer to him, That ſhe knew no place more dangerous than that, and that he was much beholding to his Butler, who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him not only with his Body and his Goods, but with his Soul alſo, and his Conſcience. The Prince perceiving, there was no remedy, reſolved with
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:119929:198"/>himſelf to force his paſſion, and to importune her no more, nevertheleſſe all his life afterwards he had her in high eſteem. A Servant of the ſaid Prince, obſerving the honeſty of this Maid, did court her in the way of marriage, to which ſhe would not conſent without the leave and commandment of the Prince, to whom ſhe had given up all her affection, which the Prince was acquainted with, and with his good will the marriage was concluded, in which ſhe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all her life afterwards with great reputation, and the young Prince did inrich her with dayly benefits.</p>

                  <hi>Ladies, what ſhall we ſay to this? have we hearts ſo low as to make our Servants our Maſters? Seeing this Virgin could not be overcome neither by love nor impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, I muſt beſeech you that by her Example we may become victorious over our ſelves, for it is the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble victory that we can obtain. I doe lament, ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla, <hi>that ſuch virtuous acts were not in the time of the old Hiſtoriographers, for they who ſo much extolled their</hi> Lucretia, <hi>would let their pens ſall from their hands, and have altered their Subjest, to have deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed all along the Virtues of this Virgin, which I do find to be ſo great, that I ſhould bardly have believed them, were it not for the ſolemn Oath which doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to ſpeak the truth. I find not her virtues to be ſuch, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>as you declare them, for oftentimes we have ſeen ſick men, whoſe Palats are out of taſt, to refuſe good and whotſom Diet, and to feed on that which is naught and hurtfull: And ſo it may be that this Maid was in love with ſome one elſe which made her to despiſe Nobility.</hi> Parlament <hi>made anſwer, Her life and her death did ſufficiently manifeſt that ſhe never (during the whole courſe of her life) had a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of any man living than of him whom ſhe loved more than her life, but not more than her Honour. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from your fancy that fond humour, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>and underſtand from whence that word</hi> Honour <hi>is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, ſo far as it belongeth unto Women: For it may be that thoſe Who ſpeak ſo much of it doe not know the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:119929:199"/>Intention of the word; Know then, that in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before Diſſimulation was too common amongſt Men, and Women, love was ſo full of life and ſtrength, that Hypocriſie had no place, and they were most praiſed, who moſt truly lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed; But when Decript and Avarice had ſeized upon their hearts, they did drive both God and Love out of them, and in their place entertained the love of themſelves, Hypocriſie, and Diſſembling. And Women perceiving that they had not in their hearts the virtue of true Love, and that the Name of Hypocriſie was ſo odious amongſt Men, they did give it the ſirname of Honour, ſo that thoſe who had not in them that true and honourable Love, did pretend that their Honour did forbid them to do this, or that, and have made thereby ſo cruel a law, that even ſome Women who would love perfectly, do Diſſemble, eſteeming Virtue to be Vice; But they who are of a good underſtanding, and of a ſound Judgement, do never fall into ſuch errours; for they do know the difference betwixt light and darkneſſe, and that true love conſiſteth in this, to ſhow the chaſtity of the heart, which cannot live but by true love, and will not ſeek for falſe Honour from the vice of Diſſimulation. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, I have heard</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Dagoucin) <hi>that the moſt private Love is the moſt commendable. Private</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Simontault) <hi>and concealed from the eys of thoſe that judge not aright, but which is clear, and known e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough unto thoſe two at leaſt, whom it doth concern. I ſo underſtand, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>and I believe that this Virgin did love more violently, becauſe ſhe did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it unto any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whatſoever ſhe did, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>we ought to look upon her Virtue, which to overcome her own heart, was the greateſt of all virtues, and the occaſions and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſhe had, being conſider'd, I do ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y that ſhe ought to be accounted a moſt excellent Virgin. If you eſteem, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>the greatneſſe of Virtue, by the mortification of our ſelves, the young Lord was more commendable than ſhe, whether you look upon the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the love which he did bear unto her, or his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:119929:199"/>and the opportunities, and the means he might have had; yet nevertheleſſe he would not offend the rule of true love, which makes the Prince and the Pooreſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be equal, and doth uſe no other means, but what Honeſty doth permit. There are many, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>who would not have done ſo. Indeed he was highly to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>having overcome the common Imperfection of Men; for he who can do evil, and doth it not, is a happy Man. To this purpoſe, ſaid</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, <hi>you cauſe me to think of one, who had a greater fear to offend the eyes of Men, than God, his Honour, or his Love. I pray you, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>will you be pleaſid to rehearſe that Account unto us, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof I do give you my voice. There are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>who believe that there is no God, or, if there be a God, they do conceive him to be ſo far from them, that he can neither ſee, nor underſtand the works they do, and although he doth ſee them, they do think he is ſo tame, or ſo unmindfull of them, that he will not puniſh them, and that he takes no Care of the things that are done on Earth. And of this opinion was a Lady, whoſe Name (for the honour I do bear unto her Family) I will change, and I will call her</hi> Camilla. <hi>She was often heard to ſay, that He or She who had nothing to do but with God only, were happy, if in the mean time they could preſerve the reputation of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour entire from the eyes of the world; but you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that neither her Wiſdom, nor her Hypocriſie, could guard her, but the myſtery of her Luſt was revealed, as you ſhall find by this Hiſtory, the truth whereof, I will give you all along, excepting the Names of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and the places, both which ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>

               <p>IN a fair Caſtle there lived a great Princeſſe, and of a great Authority, who entertained in her Company a young Lady called <hi>Camilla,</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of a bold ſpirit, by whom her Miſtreſſe was ſo governed that ſhe did nothing but by her Counſel, eſteeming her to be one of the wiſeſt and the moſt virtuous Damoſells that lived in that Age. This <hi>Camilla</hi> did ſo much inveigh againſt all fond love, that if at any time ſhe knew a Gentleman to be amorous of one of her Companions, ſhe would moſt ſharply reprehend them, and would be ſure to make ſo bad a report of it unto her Miſtreſſe, that ſeverely ſhe would check them for it, wherefore ſhe was far more feared than beloved by her Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and if at any time ſhe did ſpeak to any Man, it would be ſo loud, and with ſo great a confidence, that ſhe had the ſame to be a mortal Enemy to all love, although it was altogether contrary to her heart, for there was a Gentleman in the Service of her Miſtreſſe, with whom ſhe was ſo much taken, that it was impoſſible to be more: But the love ſhe did bear to her Glory and reputation did make her to diſſemble her affection. And having endured this paſſion a whole year, refuſing (as others) to comfort her ſelf by diſcourſe and looks, her heart ſo violently was inflamed, that ſhe was inforced to ſeek out the laſt remedy, and in the concluſion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with her ſelf, that her only courſe was to ſatisfie her Deſires, and wherein none but God
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:119929:200"/>ſhould know her heart, without making any Man partaker of it, who at one time or other would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it.</p>
               <p>This reſolution being taken, looking one day down upon the Terraſſe from the Window in her Miſtreſſes Chamber, ſhe obſerved him to be walking there whom ſo paſſionately ſhe loved, and having obſerved him until the ſetting of the Sun had taken away the full ſight of him, ſhe called to a little Page whom ſhe had, and ſhewing the Gentleman to him, ſhe ſaid unto him, Do you ſee yonder Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in that rich Cloak and Crimſon Satten Dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet, goe to him, and tell him that there is one of his friends who would ſpeak a word with him within in the Garden Gallery; and when the Boy was gone ſhe paſſed by the wardrope belonging to her Miſtreſſes Chamber, and came into the Gallery, having ſo muffled herſelf with her Scarſes that ſhe could not be diſcovered. The Gentleman being come where ſhe was, ſhe did goe immediately to ſhut the Doors of the Gallery, that no man unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly might enter in upon them, and without taking off her Maſques and her Scarſes ſhe imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him with all the ſtrength ſhe had, and ſpake unto him as ſoftly as poſſibly ſhe could, It is a long time (my friend) ſince the love which I have born unto you hath made me to ſeek out both the place and the occaſion to enjoy your company, but the fear of my Honour hath been ſo ſtrong upon me, that it hath conſtrained me to diſſemble my paſſion. But at laſt the force of love hath overcome all fear, and in the knowledge which I have of your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if you will promiſe to love me, and never to acquaint any one with it, and not to enquire who I am, I dare aſſure you for my part, that I will be to you a loyal and a faithfull friend, and that I will never love any one but your ſelf, but I had rather die than you ſhould know who I am.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman did promiſe what ſhe deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:119929:201"/>which made her the more ready to render him the like, which was to refuſe nothing which he did deſire to take. It was about five or ſix of the clock in the Winter, ſo that it was impoſſible for him to perceive who ſhe was, but touching of her cloaths, he did find they were of Velvet, which in thoſe times was not worn on every day, but only by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the nobleſt Families, and of great Authority; And concerning that which was underneath, he without light could make judgement good enough with his hand, and he found nothing but what was plump, luſty, and in good liking. If he on his part did his uttermoſt endeavour to give her the beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment he could, ſhe did no leſſe on hers, and the Gentleman perceived well enough that ſhe was a married woman. She incontinently would return from whence ſhe came, but the Gentleman ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, I do moſt highly eſteem this favour, which without my merit you have conferred on me, but I ſhall more eſteem of that which at my requeſt I ſhall receive of you: I hold my ſelf ſo honoured with this courteſie, that I muſt beſeech you to tel me, if I ought not to hope to enjoy it again, and in what time or place you will pleaſe to command me; for ſince I muſt not know you, I know not of my ſelf how to procure it. Take no care for that (ſaid the Lady) but aſſure your ſelf, that every Evening before my Miſtreſſes Supper is ſerved in, I will not fail to ſend for you, but be you ſure to be upon the Terraſſe where you were this afternoon; I will ſend you word only to remember what you promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by that word you may underſtand that I do attend you in the Gallery: But if you hear talk of going immediatly to Supper, you may for that Evening either retire home, or come into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of my Miſtreſſe: But above all things, I muſt deſire you (if you will have the continuance of my Love) that you will not ſeek after my name, nor endeavour to know who I am.</p>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:119929:201"/>
               <p>This aſſurance being made, the Damoſel and the Gentleman did return into their ſeveral places, and did a long time continue this courſe of life, and he could never perceive who it was, whereupon he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a great perplexity of mind, doubting much within himſelf what it ſhould be, for he was confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there was no Woman in the word, who would not be ſeen, and be beloved, wherefore he ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with himſelf that it was ſome evil Spirit, and the rather, becauſe he had heard a fooliſh Preacher ſay, That if we could but ſee the Devil in the face, we ſhould never be in love with him. In this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition he determined with himſelf to know who it was who came alwayes ſo muffled to him. And on the next night in which they were to meet, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him a piece of chalk, and in his imbraces of her, he did give her a long mark with it on the ſhoulder behind, which ſhe perceived not, and as ſoon as ever they departed one from the other, the Gentleman immediately repaired into the Chamber of her Miſtreſſe, and ſtood ſo near unto the Door, to obſerve behind the ſhoulders of all thoſe Ladies who did enter into the Chamber; And, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he beheld the young Lady <hi>Camilla</hi> to enter in with ſo ſevere a boldneſſe, that he was almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to look on her, as he did upon the others, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf moſt aſſured that it could not be ſhe, but when ever ſhe turned her back unto him, he obſerved plainly the white ſtroak of Chalk upon her ſhoulder, whereat he was ſo amazed, that he could hardly believe what he did ſee with his own eyes, and having a long time obſerved her height, and the ſymmetry of her body, which in all particulars reſembled her whom he had in his arms, and marked well the faſhion of her countenance, which he could not ſo perfectly diſcover as he would, he knew for certain that it was ſhe, for which he was very glad, that a young Lady who never before was know to have a ſervant, but did refuſe the love of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119929:202"/>many gallant Gentlemen, ſhould be ſurprized by him alone.</p>
               <p>Love who is never conſtant to one eſtate, could not endure that he ſhould live long in this ſafe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, but did tranſport him into ſuch a glory and vain hope, that he reſolved with himſelf to make his love known unto her, thinking that when ſhe found that it was diſcovered, it would be a means to his advantage to make her to encreaſe it. One day when the great Lady her Miſtreſſe did delight her ſelf in the Garden, <hi>Camilla</hi> did walk by her ſelf in one of the Alleys of the Garden. The Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeeing her alone, did advance himſelf to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her, and counterfeiting that he had never ſeen her in any other place, he did ſay unto her, Lady, A long time it is ſince in my heart I have carryed a great affection to you, and for fear to diſpleaſe you, I have not dared to reveal it unto you, which hath rendred me ſo weak, that without death I can no longer endure this torment, for I am confident that never any one did know or feel ſo much of love as my ſelf. The young Lady <hi>Camilla</hi> would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to finiſh his diſcourſe, but ſaid unto him in a great choler, Did you ever hear in your life that I entertained either friend or Servant? I am ſure you have not; And I doe much wonder from whence this boldneſſe ſhould proceed, that you ſhould preſume to hold this diſcourſe with one of ſo known and unblemiſhed a reputation as my ſelf, for by my Carriage and Demeanour in this Court, you might eaſily underſtand that I never loved any but my Husband only, and for this cauſe take heed how you continue this diſcourſe. The Gentleman obſerving her great diſſimulation could not contain himſelf from laughter, and ſaid unto her, Madam, you have not been ſo rigorous unto me as you are at this preſent.</p>
               <p>To what end doth it ſerve you to uſe ſuch diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to me, were it not far better to have a love per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:119929:202"/>than imperfect? <hi>Camilla</hi> made anſwer to him, I bear no more love unto you, either perfect, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, than I do unto any other of the Servants of my Miſtreſs: But if you continue in the diſcourſe you have begun, you ſhall find that I do bear ſuch a hate unto you, that you may have the leiſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it. The Gentleman, for all that, did purſue his Diſcourſe, and ſaid unto her, And where is now the good entertainment you were accuſtomed to give me, when I muſt not ſee you? why do you deprive me of the happineſs that the Day may not ſhew me your beauties, attended with ſo many Graces? <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi> making a great ſign of the Croſs, did ſay unto him, You have either loſt your underſtanding, or are one of the greateſt lyars in the world; For ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in my life (as I do know of) did I either give you better or worſe entertainment, than at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and I pray let me underſtand what you doe mean by it.

For, leaving him in the Alley, ſhe did repair to her Miſtreſſe in a moſt violent Rage, who loving her as her ſelf, and ſeeing her ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, did forſake all the Company, to enquire of her the occaſion of her choler, which <hi>Camilla</hi> did not conceal, but word for word did acquaint her all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with the Diſcourſe which paſſed betwixt the Gentleman and her ſelf, and ſo much to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the poor Gentleman, that on that very Evening his Miſtreſs did command him immediatly
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:119929:203"/>to depart her Court, and without ſpeaking any thing to any body, to retire himſelf to his own houſe, and to ſtay there until ſhe ſent for him. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Miſtreſs was diſagreeable unto him, but he did ſuddenly perform it, for fear of worſe; and as long as <hi>Camilla</hi> lived with her Miſtreſs, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman came not any more to the Court, nor ever received any News from her concerning that which ſhe had ſo often promiſed, and which he had loſt on that hour when hee had diſcovered who ſhe was.</p>

                  <hi>Ladies, by this you may perceive how ſhe, who above her Conſcience preferred the glory of this world, did loſe both the one and the other, for that was diſcovered to the eys of all men, which ſhe would have concealed from her Husband and her Servant, and ſeeking to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the mockery of them, ſhe fell into the ſcandal of all; And ſhe cannot be excuſed by the ſimplicity of a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Love, on which every one ought to have Compaſſion, but ſhe is doubly to be condemned, to have ſhaddowed her Deceit under the mantle of Honour and of Glory, and to make her ſelf before God and Men to be better than ſhe was; But he who giveth not his Glory unto another, in drawing open the Curtain did reveal her to her dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Infamy.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The fourth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Paris</hi> there were two Citizens of a conſiderable Eſtate, the one a Lawyer, the other a Mercer, who for a long time did bear a great affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to one another; by the means whereof the Son of the Lawyer, called <hi>James,</hi> a young Man, and a fine Companion, did oftentimes frequent the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers houſe in pretence of the Love that was ſhewed to his Father, but it was indeed, in love to the fair Daughter of the Mercer, whoſe Name was <hi>Frances;</hi> And <hi>James</hi> did make his addreſſes ſo effectual to her, that he knew he was no leſs beloved than he did love. But in the time of this Courtſhip the War began in <hi>Provence,</hi> by reaſon of the Invaſion of <hi>Charls</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> was enforced to follow the War, to ſerve according to the Eſtate in which he was.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of theſe Wars his Father dyed, the News whereof did convey a double affliction to him, the one was for the loſs of his Father, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:119929:204"/>was for the inconvenience which that loſſe brought with it, which was, that on his return he ſhould be deprived of the opportunity of ſeeing his Sweet-heart ſo often as he hoped to have done: Nevertheleſſe in a ſhort proceſs of time the one was forgotten, and the other increaſed; for as Death is a thing natural, and more natural to the Father than to the Children, ſo grief by little and little of it ſelf doth wear away: But Love, inſtead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying death unto us, doth bring us life by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of Children who doe render us immortal, which is one of the moſt principal motives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our deſires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>James</hi> being returned to <hi>Paris</hi> had no other thought or care than to put himſelf again into the train, and the vulgar frequentation of the Mercers houſe, where, under the umbrage of his former love, he might traffick with his deareſt merchandiſe. On the other ſide, during his abſence, <hi>Frances</hi> was ſollicited and courted by diverſe, as well for her beauty as for her wit and underſtanding, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo becauſe ſhe was fully marriageable, although her Father was not forward to ſeek out a Husband for her, whether it were through covetouſneſſe, or a provident deſire to have her richly placed ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his only Daughter.</p>

                  <hi>James</hi> to endure, being not able in his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to reſolve himſelf what was the reaſon that ſhe was guarded with ſo much ſeverity, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no occaſion for it, he could not tell what certainly to conclude upon, but did waver betwixt Love and Jealouſie. At the laſt he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with himſelf, come what would of it, he would know the reaſon. But firſt of all to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand if ſhe were of the ſame affection as ſhe was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he did ſo often goe, and come where ſhe uſed to reſort, that one Morning hearing Maſſe in the Church, and being very near unto her, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by her countenance that ſhe was no leſſe glad to ſee him than he was to ſee her, and knowing alſo that her Mother was not ſo ſtrict over her as her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he took one day the boldneſſe (as it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly ſeeing them goe from their Houſe unto the Church) to accoſt them with a familiar and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar complement, and not too expreſſely to declare himſelf, that he might better arrive to the end of his Deſign.</p>
               <p>The end of the year approaching in which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died, he determined with himſelf to leave off his mourning, and to put himſelf into ſuch a habit as might become the honour of his Anceſtors, and acquainted his Mother with it, who did like it very well, deſiring with all her heart to ſee him well married, becauſe ſhe had no more Sons, and but one Daughter, who was already married and very richly, and moreover ſhe did inure her heart to the Love of virtue by the infinite Examples of other young Gentlewomen of her age, who either did advance themſelves, or at leaſt ſhewed themſelves worthy of the Family from whence they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. There was nothing more to doe, but to conſider in what ſhop they might beſt provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. His Mother ſaid unto him, <hi>James,</hi> I think it moſt expedient to goe to my Husbands Compeeire, Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> (who was the Father of <hi>Frances</hi>) for
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:119929:205"/>(ſaid ſhe) he it one of our Friends, and will not deceive us. That word much pleaſed her Son, and he greedily ſwallowed it, nevertheleſſe he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mother, we will buy it there, where we can find our beſt Market, but becauſe he was an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of my Fathers I am content to goe thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>The Agreement was made, and one morning the Mother and the Son did go to Mr. <hi>Peters</hi> houſe, who received them with many expreſſions of reſpect, as you know few Shop-keepers are unprovided in that kind. A great variety of whole pieces of Silks were laid open upon the board, and they might chuſe what they pleaſed, but they could not agree upon the price, which <hi>James</hi> did on purpoſe, becauſe he could not ſee the Mother of his Sweet-heart, and at laſt they were going without buying any thing at all, to try what they could do in another place. But <hi>James</hi> did like nothing ſo well, as what he cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned at his Sweet-hearts Fathers houſe, whither ſome hours afterwards they returned. They found then her Mother within, who did give them the beſt welcom in the world, and after the words of courſe which are accuſtomed in ſuch ſhops, the Wife of the Mercer being more hard to deal with than the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer himſelf, <hi>James</hi> ſaid unto her, You are grown Lady very hard, ſee what it is to loſe a good Father, Now we cannot be known here, and with that he made an apparence as if he wept, and wiped his eys in the remembrance of the dear Father which he loſt; but this was only to play his own cards the better. The good Woman the Widdow, who was <hi>James</hi> his Mother, being preſent, did comply with him, and ſaid, I in good troth, ſince his Death we are no more viſited than if we had never ſeen one another, and this is all the reckoning that is made of poor Widdows. Hereupon they did grow into new Indearments, and the Mercers Wife did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to viſit her more often than ever. And as they
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:119929:205"/>were ſpeaking thoſe words, there came in other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers, whom the Maſter did lead into another Shop; And the young Man taking his opportunity, ſaid unto his Mother, I would (forſooth) that ſhe would be pleaſed to come to us upon ſome Feſtival days to viſit the holy places which are about us, and eſpecially the Religious; if ſhe would vouchſafe ſometimes (as ſhe paſſeth by) to take a Cup of wine, it would be a great pleaſure, and an honour to us.</p>
               <p>The Mercers Wife, who thought no evill, made anſwer to them, that a fortnight ago ſhe had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with her ſelf to walk abroad to ſee her friends, and that if the Sunday following was a fair day, ſhe would take her pleaſure then, and as ſhe paſſed by, ſhe would give a viſit to her. This being agreed upon, the agreement followed for the price of the pieces of ſilk; for <hi>James</hi> thought it was not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for the value of a litttle ſilver to loſe ſo fair an opportunity. The plot being laid, and the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe carryed away, <hi>James</hi> perceiving that he alone was not able to carry on the enterprize, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to declare himſelf unto a faithfull Friend, and they both did lay their heads ſo well together, that there wanted nothing but the performance. On the Sunday following the Mercers Wife and her Daughter on their return from their Devotions did not fail to call at the Widdows houſe, where they found her with a good Woman, a Neighbour of hers, talking together in the gallery belonging to the Garden, there was alſo the Daughter of the Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, <hi>James</hi> his Siſter, who was walking up and down the Allees of the Garden with her Brother, and <hi>Oliver. James,</hi> when he beheld his Sweet-heart, did ſo compoſe his countenance, that he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the leaſt ſign of Joy, and in that grave garb did addreſs himſelf both to the Mother and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And as it is ordinary, that the Old do always keep company with the Old, the three Women did
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:119929:206"/>ſit upon a Bank, which was ſo made, that they were inforced to turn their backs towards the Garden, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, by degrees, the two lovers entred, and walked untill they came unto the place where <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> and his Siſter were, where ſome Salutations and Complements being paſſed, they did walk again in the Allees of the Garden, where the young Man did ſo well declare his intire affection to <hi>Frances,</hi> that ſhe could not but have compaſſion on him, and did not altogether refuſe that which her friend deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſo that he perceived that ſhe was comming on, and according to his expectation.</p>
               <p>But you are to underſtand, that during the time they were in this Communication, they oftentimes walked up and down by the Bank where the good Women ſate, to take away ſuſpition from them, talking ſometimes aloud of vulgar and familiar Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſometimes making an apparence, as if they were in a great Conteſtation. And in this manner they paſſed up and down not far from the good Women for the ſpace of half an hour, at which time <hi>James</hi> made a ſign to <hi>Oliver,</hi> who played his part alſo vell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Here <hi>James</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of giving his Sweet-heart a Green Gown did give her a Red one, for her blood did fluſh into her cheeks to find her ſelf ſurpriſed before ſhe was aware. They had ſo readily gathered their plumbs, becauſe they were ripe, that <hi>Oliver</hi> could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, were it not that he beheld the Maid to hold her head down towards the ground, as if ſhe had been aſhamed, which gave unto him a token of the Truth, for before as ſhe walked ſhe did hold up her head, without any fear that the vein in her
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:119929:206"/>eye which ought to be red, ſhould be ſeen to have taken the Azure colour, which <hi>James</hi> perceiving with Remonſtrances neceſſary to that purpoſe, did endeavour to reſtore it to its firſt complexion; and walking afterwards three or four turns in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, it was. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

What ſhall I doe? you have undone me for ever; In what Fame ſhall I now live? What ſhall become of me? I aſſure my ſelf that you will make no more reckoning of me, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you are in the number of thoſe who do only love for pleaſure. Alas the time that ever I was born, or being born that I had not died before I fell into this error. Theſe words were not uttered without abundance of tears; But <hi>James</hi> did ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her with ſo many ſolemn Promiſes and Oaths, that after they had walked three or four turns in the Garden more, and he had made a ſign to his Companion, they ented again into the Graſſeplat by another way, where <hi>James</hi> did not behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo unmanly, but ſhe received far more pleaſure at the giving of the ſecond Green Gown than at the firſt, and moreover did like ſo well of it, that they entred into a conſultation how they might ſee one another more often, and more to their delight. In which a young Woman, a Neigbour of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and one of <hi>James</hi> his Kinſwomen, and one who was a very good Friend to <hi>Frances,</hi> did very much aſſiſt them: In this condition of life (for ought that I can underſtand) they continued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſcandal until the conſummation of their marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which was a very rich one for the Daughter of a Mercer, in regard ſhe was the only child he had. True enough it is, that <hi>James</hi> a long time ſtayed for the death of the Father, who was ſo locked up to himſelf, that it ſeemed to him, what he held faſt in one hand, the other would ſteal from it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, you may here behold, a Love well begun, well continued, and beſt of all concluded; for although it is a common thing with you Men, to diſdain a Maid or Woman, who hath been too liberal to you of that which you moſt ſeek of her; ſo it is, that this Gentleman being poſſeſſed with a true and ſincere Love, and having known</hi> that <hi>in his Sweet-heart which every Husband deſireth in her whom he hath eſpouſed, and finding her alſo wiſe, and well deſcended, would not forſake her, he himſelf being the occaſion of the fault that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; neither would he be the Cauſe that ſhe ſhould be unfortunately married to another, but with much pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence attended the happy hour to espouſe her himſelf, in which he is much to be commended.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſpeak the truth, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>they were both of them worthy of blame, and the Third alſo who was their</hi> Go-between, <hi>and an Adjunct in this Violation of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. Do you call that a Violation, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>when two parties are ſo well accorded? Can there be a better Marriage than that which is celebrated by Lovers? This is the occaſion of the Proverb, that Marriages are made in Heaven; And it is not to be underſtood of forced Marriages, not of thoſe which are made for the lucre of money, and which have been approved, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Mother have given their Conſent unto them.

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:119929:207"/>Wherefore let young people, who know not what doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto themſelves, firſt examine, and prove, what without Conſideration they have begun, and by little and little they will diſcover thoſe errours, which will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion them to enter into a greater emazement. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the moſt part of thoſe Marriages which are made by compulſion, do proceed from the experience of thoſe, who have more ſight and judgement than thoſe whom moſt nearly it doth concern: inſomuch, that when they come to the years of diſcretion, to be ſenſible of the Good which they did not underſtand, they will then both acknowledge it, and imbrace it with a more diſtinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and with a far greater affection. But Madam, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>you make no mention at all that the Maid was of a good Age, and marriageable, and underſtood well enough the Iniquity of her Father, who would not have the Maidenhead of his Daughter to be loſt, becauſe he would have his Crowns to be ſaved; And do you not know, that Nature of her ſelf is the moſt provident Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife? This Maid loved, ſhe was beloved, ſhe knew of her ſelf what ſhe had to do, and was old enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Proverb, Thoſe who refuſe, do afterwards repent. All theſe things put together, with the prompt execution of the Wooer, did not give her the leiſure to withſtand him. You have heard alſo in this Account, that preſently afterwards it was to be diſcovered by her face, that there was ſome remarkable change, which, peradventure, was occaſioned by the ſorrow which ſhe entertained, that ſhe had no more leiſure to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing that was done was good, or evil; for ſhe did not with any great unwillingneſſe, draw back from giving conſent to the ſecond Aſſault. For my part, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>I cannot excuſe her, but muſt approve of the faith of the young Man, who governing himſelf by the Laws of Honeſty, would not abandon her, especially ſince he had made her ſuch as ſhe was. In which he ſeems to me to be worthy of the higheſt Commendation; eſpecially if we conſider the depraved Corruption of Youth in theſe preſent times: Howſoever, for all this

He was afraid to diſpleaſe her, and her endeavour was to obey and pleaſe him in all things, but for all the good love he did bear unto her, he was withall ſo charitable, that oftentimes he gave that unto his neighbours which did belong unto his Wife, although he carried it as ſecretly as poſſibly he could. He had in his houſe a Chambermaid, a Wench of a delicate complexion, of whom he was very amorous, and nevertheleſſe fearing that his Wife ſhould take notice of it, he often made an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence to his Wife to rebuke and chide her, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her Miſtreſſe that ſhe was the lazieſt Slut that ever he ſaw, and that he did much wonder that ſhe did not beat her; And ſpeaking one day of whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and chaſtiſing little Children, he ſaid unto his Wife, it would be a good Almes to give ſuch ſtripes to your lazy Girl whom you keep, but then it muſt not be with your hand, for your hand is too weak, and your heart too pittiful; I doe believe if ſhe ſhould feel the weight of my hand, we ſhould be far better ſerved by her than we are.</p>
               <p>The poor Woman who thought no hurt at all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him that he would put in execution what he ſaid, confeſſing that ſhe had neither the heart nor the ſtrength to beat her. Her Husband who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted of this Commiſſion, did put on the Face of a cruel Beadle, and provided himſelf with Rods of the ſmalleſt twigs that poſſibly he could find, and to manifeſt the great deſire he had to ſhew no mercy, he did put them into urine, ſo that the poor Woman took more pity of her Chambermaid, than ſhe had ſuſpition of her Husband.</p>
               <p>The Day of <hi>Innocents</hi> being come, her Husband did riſe yery early in the morning, and did go up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Garret where the Chambermaid was all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:119929:209"/>and there he did chaſtiſe her, but in anot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> manner than he told his Wife. The Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid began to weep abundantly, but it would not ſerve her turn; Nevertheleſſe, for fear his Wife ſhould ſurprize him, he took the Rods, and did ſo lay on with them upon the poſts of the Bed, that he did break and ſplit them to pieces, and ſo brought them to his Wife, ſaying, Sweet-heart, I do believe ſhe will remember <hi>Innocents</hi> day as long as ſhe doth live, and going upon ſome occaſion out of doors, the Chambermaid obſerving that her Maſter was gone forth, ſhe did come unto her Miſtreſſe, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down with both knees, ſhe told her, That her Husband had done her the greateſt wrong that ever was done to a poor Chambermaid. Her Miſtreſſe believing that it was by reaſon of the Rods, and the ſtripes which ſhe thought her Husband had given her, did not permit her to end her Complaints, but ſaid unto her, My Husband hath done well in it, for I have been with him every day this Moneth and more to intreat him to it, and if he hath made you to endure that which you would not, I am very glad of it, you ought to take it as it comes from my ſelf, and to believe, that he hath not taken half ſo much pains with you, as he ought to have done.</p>
               <p>The Chambermaid perceiving that her Miſtreſſe did approve what was done, did believe that it was not ſo great a Sin, as ſhe did perſwade her ſelf to be, and the rather, becauſe that ſhe, who was eſteemed to be ſo good a Woman, was the occaſion of it; wherefore ſhe durſt not talk to her any more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it: And her Maſter obſerving his Wife to be as well contented to be deceived, as he was to deceive her, did determine with himſelf to content her in this kind more often, and gained ſo much the heart of his Chambermaid, that ſhe would weep no more at any ſuch chaſtiſements. This life he continued a long time, and his Wife perceived nothing at all. At laſt the great Snows came, and her Maſter, as he
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:119929:209"/>often before had given his Maid chaſtiſement upon the green graſs, ſo he would now give it her upon the Snow alſo. One morning before any one elſe in his Houſe was ſtirring, he took her with him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing on her but her ſmock only, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her down, he ſtretched forth her hands and her leggs, to make a Crucifix upon the Snow, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards exerciſing themſelves with flinging Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls on one another, he forgot not the ſport of chaſtiſement, which a good Woman, one of his Neighbors, obſerved, looking out at a Window whoſe proſpect was directly into that his Garden, Her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was only to ſee what Weather it was; but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſo hot an Exerciſe in ſo cold a Morning, ſhe was ſo angry at it, that ſhe reſolved with her ſelf to acquaint her Neighbor with it, to the end ſhe might be no more abuſed by ſo bad a Husband, nor ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward a Maid. Her Husband having performed all his Recreations, looked up to ſee if no body did obſerve him, and perceived his Neighbours Wife looking out of the window, for which he was very ſorry; but he, whoſe profeſſion it was to give a good Colour to any work, did contrive with himſelf which way ſo well to ſhaddow this, that his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour might be as well deceived as his Wife: and going to Bed again, he was no ſooner warm, but immediately he cauſed his Wife to riſe, and in her ſmock did lead her into the ſame Garden into which he had brought his Maid, and plaid with her along time in the Snow, and at the laſt did give her the ſame Chaſtiſement as he gave his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, and afterwards they did both go to Bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Some three hours afterwards when this good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did go to Maſſe, her Neigbour being a good friend of hers, did not fail to be there alſo, and out of the great zeal which ſhe had to her, ſhe deſired her that ſhe would put away her Chambermaid without asking her any further for what cauſe, for
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:119929:210"/>it was enough that ſhe knew her to be a naughty and a dangerous baggage. The good Woman refuſed to doe it, unleſſe ſhe were informed upon what grounds her neighbour had entertained ſo bad an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of her, who in the end did account unto her all what ſhe had ſeen that morning in the Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her and her Husband.</p>
               <p>The good Woman could not forbear from laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſaid unto her, Alack a day my good friend, it was my ſelf. Say you ſo? replied her neighbour, She had nothing on her but her Smock only, and it was about five or ſix a clock in the morning. The good Woman made anſwer, in good troth (Goſſipp) it was my ſelf. The other not willing to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted proceeded in her obſervations: Firſt, ſaid ſhe, I did ſee them to throw Snow, and to play to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with one another, afterwards he did put his hand to her Breſt, and after that to another place as cloſely as poſſibly could be. The good Woman laughing out right did aſſure her that it was none but her ſelf. Say not ſo (ſaid the other) I did ſee him upon the Snow to doe ſuch and ſuch a thing, which in my opinion is not fair nor honeſt. Why Neighbour (ſaid the good Woman) will you not believe me, I have told you often enough already, and muſt tell you again, that it was my ſelf and none elſe, I did all this as you ſpeak of with my Husband, I pray you to take no offence at it, for you know we are bound to pleaſe our Husbands.</p>
               <p>Her Neighbour ſeeing ſhe could not prevail upon her to believe it, did return to her own houſe more deſirous to have ſuch a Husband than to make any more complaints againſt him. Her Husband being returned, his Wife did acquaint him Word for Word with what her Neighbour told her. He ſaid unto her, You may ſee by this (Sweet-heart) if you were not a good Woman, and of a good underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we had long agoe been ſeparated from one another, but God (I hope) will preſerve us in
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:119929:210"/>our Love, to his Glory and our Contentment: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> (Sweet-heart) ſaid the good Woman, I do hope that on my part you ſhall find no fault.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, He will hardly be believed, who after this Hiſtory will affirm that there is ſuch a ſubtilty in Women as in Men, nevertheleſs, without doing wrong to either ſex, I may be allowed to ſpeak the truth both of Men and women, and to affirm that there is nothing good at all ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the one or the other. But this Man, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>was marvellouſly deceitfull; for on the one ſide he couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Maid, and on the other ſide his Wife. You do not well underſtand the ſtory I perceive, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>for that ſaith, that he did content them both on one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not deceive them, which I look upon as a great Act of Virtue, both of body, and of mind, as well by deeds as by words to give content unto two divers perſons. In that, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>he is doubly to be blamed, in ſatisfying the ſimplicity of the one by Diſſimulation, and and the longings of the other by Luſt; but I understand well enough, that ſuch Sins as theſe being brought before ſuch a Judge as you, will find an eaſie pardon. You may aſſure your ſelf, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>to pleaſe two at once is no eaſie task, and for my own part I will never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo great and difficult an enterpriſe. I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you my Account already, and think herein I have not ill imployed my days work. If a mutual Love, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>cannot content the heart, I know no other thing in the world that can give content unto it. To ſpeak the truth, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>I do believe that there is not a greater puniſhment in the world, than to love, and not to be beloved again. I do believe you, ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla, <hi>and to that purpoſe I do remember a Story, which indeed doth not deſerve to be numbred on the file of good ones, but becauſe it is for the preſent purpoſe, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to declare it to you.</hi>

               <head>Of a Frier, whoſe Cuſtom it was to bring his complaints to ſeveral Husbands, which was the occaſion that they did beat their Wives.</head>
               <head type="sub">The ſixth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Angouleſm,</hi> where Count <hi>Charls</hi> the Father of King <hi>Francis</hi> had oftentimes his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, there was a Frier called <hi>De Valles,</hi> a very knowing Man, and ſo great a Preacher, that upon all Sundays in the <hi>Advents</hi> he preached in the City before the Count, by means whereof his Reputation was much increaſed. It ſo fell out, that during the <hi>Advent</hi> a luſty young fellow of the City having married a handſom young Wench, did not deſiſt for all that to ramble up and down, and to live as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, if not more, than thoſe who were unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; of which the young Woman being advertiſed, could not hold her peace, ſo that following him up and down, and exclaiming on him, ſhe received ſuch tokens from him as ſhe would not willingly have, and nevertheleſſe for all that ſhe did not forbear to continue her exclamations, and oftentimes would ſpeak very high words, and moſt paſſionately rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The young Man being much incited at it, did begin to lay about him, and to leave on her ſhoulders the marks of his diſpleaſure; whereat ſhe began to cry out far louder than before, and her Neighbours alſo that knew the occaſion of it, would inveigh againſt him, and making a great noiſe in the ſtreets, would cry out, Now fie on all ſuch Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, Let them go all to the Devil. The Frier <hi>De Valles</hi> paſſing by that way, and underſtanding the noiſe, and the occaſion of it, did determine with himſelf to ſpeak one word of it in his next dayes Sermon, which accordingly he did; for ſpeaking of marriage, and of the love which ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:119929:211"/>the Husband and the Wife, he did highly praiſe it, and blamed thoſe that did go about to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate it; and making a compariſon betwixt conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal and paternal Love, he ſaid, amongſt other things, That it was a greater danger, and a more grievous puniſhment for a Husband to beat his Wife, than to beat his Father, or his Mother; for (ſaid he) if you beat your Father, or your Mother, you are ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to do penance, but if you beat your Wife, both ſhe and all her Neighbours will fall a curſing of you, and ſend you immediately to the Devil, that is to ſay, to Hell. You are to obſerve now (ſaid he) what a difference there is betwixt theſe two penances, for from <hi>Rome</hi> they do ordinarily come back again, but from Hell-Oh- There is no tetur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Nulla eſt redemptio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not long after that Sermon, he was advertiſed that Women made their boaſts of that which he preached, and that their Husbands could live in no quiet for them, for which in his next Sermon he did reſolve to preſcribe an Order for the redreſſe of that inconvenience: And in ſome part of it, he compared Women unto Devils, and ſaid, that they two were the greateſt Enemies that Man had, for they did always tempt Man without any intermiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he could never get rid of them, eſpecially of the Woman; for the Devils (he ſaid) will fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if they be but ſhewed the Croſſe, but Women, clean contrary to them, will cleave the faſter to them, being the greateſt croſs themſelves that can be to their Husbands, And this doth make them ſo to run, and to go, and doth throw them into ſuch an infinity of paſſions: But good people, be ruled by me, and I will tell you what you ſhall do; When you do find that your Wives do torment you in this manner without ceaſe, as (I have ſaid) they are accuſtomed to do, take off the handle from your cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſix, and with that handle drive them as far from you as you can. Do as I bid you, and vigorouſly
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:119929:212"/>make experience of it three or four times, and you ſhall find the good that will come of it; you ſhall find that in the ſame manner that you doe chaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Devil by the virtue of the Croſſe, you ſhall alſo chaſe away and make your Wives to hold their peace by the Virtue of the handle of the Croſſe, and they will no more preſume to come too near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</p>

Howſoever it is, ſaid</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, <hi>I ſhould never love that man who would make ſo great a ſeparation betwixt my Husband and my ſelf, as to make him beat me; for blowes make love to ſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Yet nevertheleſſe (as I have heard) ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe Impoſtures do carry themſelves, when they would have a poor Woman at advantage, that I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is more danger to give ear unto them privatly, than publickly to receive blowes from their Husband, who, if it were not for ſuch buſie pretenders, would be good enough. To ſpeak the truth, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>the trains they have laid are on every ſide ſo many, that it
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:119929:212"/>is not without cauſe to fear them, although in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that Perſon who is not fearful or ſuspitious is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe. Nevertheleſſe, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>we ought to ſuſpect the evil which we would avoid, for it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſuſpect the Evil which is not, than fooliſhly by not believing it to fall into the Evil which is. For my part, I never ſaw a Woman deceived in being ſlow to give credence to the words of Men, but I have heard of many that have been ruined by giving too ready a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to their falſe proteſtations; wherefore I affirm, that the Evil which can arrive cannot be too much ſuspected by thoſe who have the charge both of Men and Women, and Cities, and Eſtates; for be the watch never ſo ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly obſerved, and be there never ſo many eyes imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet Forgeries and Treaſons will abound: The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that is not vigilant is every way deceived by the ſubtilty of the Fox and the cruelty of the Wolf. And yet ſo it is, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>that a perſon that is ſuſpitious can never entertain any abſolute friendſhip, and love hath been oftentimes eſtranged, if not ſeparated, by ſuspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only.

               <head type="sub">The ſeventh Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the Country of <hi>Percha</hi> there were two Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who from the time of their firſt Infancy did continue in ſo great and an entire a love, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them there was but one heart, one houſe, one bed, and one table. They along time did live in this perfect Amity, enjoying one thought, and one will; you might ſee indeed a diſtinction of perſons, but they lived together not only as two Brothers, but as if that both of them had made but one entire Man. The one of them was married, yet did not diſcontinue for all that to maintain his old Love, and daily to live with his Companion as he had been accuſtomed to do; And if at any time in their Travels they wanted a ſecond Bed, his friend did lie in the ſame Bed with himſelf and his Wife; It is true enough that at that time he himſelf did always lie in the middle. Their Goods were alſo in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. It was not Marriage that could hinder the eſtabliſhment of their love. Nevertheleſs in the progreſs of time the felicity of the world, which is ſubject to mutability, could not any longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in this Houſe, which was indeed too happy, and in too permanent a condition; for the Husband for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the aſſurance which he had in his Friend, without any occaſion at all, did entertain a great jealouſie of his Wife and him: He did not diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it to his Wife, and did acquaint her with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing tydings; whereat ſhe was much aſtoniſhed, for he had commanded her in all things, but in one, to make as much of his Companion as of himſelf, and now he expreſly did forbid her to ſpeak unto
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:119929:213"/>him, unleſs ſhe were in ſome publick Company. She took the opportunity to acquaint the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her Husband with it, who did not believe it; knowing well enough that he never thought, nor did any thing, whereat his Companion ſhould be afflicted: And being accuſtomed to conceal nothing from him, he did acquaint him with what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, deſiring him that he would not conceal the truth from him; for he would not, either in that, or any other thing, give him an occaſion to break that love with ſo long they had entertained.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman that was marryed did aſſure him, that he had never any ſuch thought, and that they who brought this Information to him were moſt wicked lyars. His Companion told him, I know well enough that Jealouſie is a paſſion as inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Love, and if you ſhould be ſurprized with it, yet I would do you no Injury at all; for I know it is a paſſion that grows ſo upon a Man, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help it. But of one thing which lies in your power to help, I find I have juſt reaſon to complain, which is, that you conceal this paſſion from me, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heretofore there was not that thing which you would conceal from me. I will ſay as much of my ſelf, If I were amorous of your Wife, you ought not to impute it unto me as any great Iniquity; for it is a fire which I hold not in my hand to do with it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my own pleaſure; but if I ſhould conceal it from you, and endeavour to make your Wife ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, I ſhould be one of the wickedeſt Companions that ever was. For my part I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that albeit ſhe is an honeſt and a virtuous Gentlewoman, yet, were ſhe not your Wife, I do not know any Woman that I have a leſs Fancy to. But, although there be no occaſion for it, I deſire you, if you but harbour the leaſt ſcruple of ſuſpition that poſſibly may be, that you would acquaint me with it, to the end I may give ſuch Order, that our love, which hath ſo long continued, may not be
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:119929:214"/>diſſolved for a Woman, for if I loved her above all Creatures in the World, yet I would never ſpeak any more unto hrr, becauſe I doe prefer your love above all others. His Companion did ſwear unto him by the greateſt Oaths that could poſſibly be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, that he never had any ſuch thought, and deſired him to make uſe of his houſe as he was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to doe. His Friend made anſwer to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is your deſire I will doe it, but I muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, that if for the time to come you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any ſuch opinion of me, that you will not diſſemble it, and that you will not think ill of it, if I ſhall never again keep company with you. At the end of ſome Moneths, after they had lived together in their accuſtomed familiarities, the married Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did enter again into his former Jealouſie more than ever, and commanded his Wife to look no more upon him with that Countenance which ſhe had been accuſtomed to doe, which ſhe again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to the Companion of her Husband, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, of her ſelf, that he would be pleaſed to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to ſpeak any more unto her, for ſhe had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for her own part an expreſſe Commandment to that purpoſe from her Husband.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman underſtood by theſe words of hers, and by the Countenance which he obſerved that ſhe did make unto her Husband, that he had not kept his promiſe with him, wherefore he ſaid unto him in a great Cholet, If you are jealous my Companion, it is a thing natural, but after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Oaths which you have made unto me, I am for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to find that which you labour ſo much to conceal from me; For I always thought that there had been no <hi>Medium,</hi> nor Obſtacle betwixt your heart and mine, but to my great grief, and without the leaſt occaſion I doe find the contrary, becauſe you are not only fooliſhly jealous of your Wife and of my ſelf, but you doe indeavour to cover it, that the diſeaſe may increaſe ſo long upon you, that it may

               <p>I have hated that which you ſuſpect, and have done what I could to avoid the inconvenience, but becauſe you do ſuſpect me to be ſo wicked, and to be contrary to that which I have always been unto you, I doe ſwear unto you, and doe promiſe you upon my faith, that now I will be ſuch as you eſteem me to be, and I will never ceaſe until I have had that of your Wife which you think I have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already, and for the time to come look to it, for ſince that Jealouſie hath ſeparated you from the love of me, Deſpite ſhall ſever me from the love of men. Although his Companion did indeavour to perſwade him to the contrary, yet he would not take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, but took his part of thoſe goods and movables, which before were in common betwixt them, and they were as much divided in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as they were before united, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was not married was as good as his word, for he did never leave to court the ſuſpected Lady until he had cornuted his Companion, as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him that he would.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here Ladies they may learn, and grow wiſe, who unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe ſuſpect their Wives, for many are the cauſe that they are ſuch as they ſuspect themſelves to be, for a Woman of spirit and underſtanding is more overcome by Despite than by all the pleaſures in the World. If any one ſhall affirm that jealouſie is love, I ſhall deny it, but it doth proceed from it indeed, as the sparks from the fire, and is as deſtructive. I do believe, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that there neither is nor can be a greater displeaſure to Man or Woman, than to be ſuspected when there is no cauſe for it, and for my ſelf, there is nothing that ſo much doth make me to break off the Company of my Friends than this ſuſpition. It is not, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>a reaſonable excuſe for a Woman to revenge the jealouſie of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, by bringing a ſhame and a diſhonour upon her ſelf.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:119929:215"/>It is to do like that weak man, who not being able to kill his Enemy, doth wound himſelf with a ſword; or that weak woman, who becauſe ſhe cannot come to ſcratch her Enemy, doth bite off her own nails for anger: But ſhe had done more wiſely not to have ſpoken to him, but only to have repreſented unto her Husband the wrong which he had done her by his unjuſt jealouſie; for time might have made them friends again. If this, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>was the Reſolution of a Wife, and that other Wives ſhould do the like, there are many Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands who would not be ſo arrogant and outragious as they are. Whatſoever it were, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>it is patience that doth render a Woman at the laſt victorious, It is chaſtity that doth render her commendable, and it behoveth us to ſtay there. Nevertheleſſe, ſaid</hi> Emarſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, <hi>a Woman may well be not chaſt without ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How underſtand you that, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla? <hi>When ſhe miſtakes another for her Husband, replyed</hi> Emarſuite; <hi>or is ſo ſottiſh, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that ſhe knows not the difference between her Husband and another, in whatſoever habiliments he ſhall diſguiſe himſelf.

               <head>Of Two Grey-Friers who on the Wedding-Night did one after the other uſurp the place of the Bridegroom, for which they were ſeverely puniſhed.</head>
               <head type="sub">The eighth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN a village in the Country of <hi>Perigard,</hi> there was kept in an Inn the Marriage of the Daughter of the Hoſt, where her Parents, and all her Friends did inforce themſelves to make the beſt chear that poſſibly they could. On the Wedding-day there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived two Friers, who had their Supper ſent them up into their Chamber, becauſe it was not lawfull for ſuch mortified Men to be preſent at Weddings; But the Elder of them, who had more Authority and Knavery than the other, did reſolve with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that although he could not be preſent at the Table with the Bride, yet he would partake with the Bridegroom in his Bed, and that he would now play a game, in which he would ſhew his Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece.</p>
               <p>When the Night came, and the Dancing began, the Frier did look a long time out of the Window upon the Bride, and obſerved her to be fair and lovely, and according to his own mind; and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Governour of the Chamberlains where ſhe was to lie, he found that the Brides Chamber was next unto his own, at which he was very glad, and ſo ſtrictly did watch her, that he ſaw the Bride undreſſed by the old women, who (according to the Cuſtom) did bring her to her Chamber: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a day of mirth, and his friends were round about him, the Bridegroom would not forſake the Dance, but was ſo much affected to it, that it ſeemed he had forgot his Wife. But the Frier had not forgot her, for as ſoon as he perceived that ſhe was in bed, and left alone, he did put off his grey
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:119929:216"/>mantle, and took the place of the married man, but for fear of being diſcovered he made but a ſhort ſtay there, and made haſt to the place where he found his companion, who watched for him; Putting on his grey mantle he ſtood now Centinul for the other Frier, who to ſatisfie his wicked concupiſcence did goe to the Brides bed as the other did before him, where he ſtayed till his Companion made a ſign that it was time to come away. The Bridegroom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came to the bed, and the Bride who had been ſo much tormented by the Friers, that ſhe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red rather reſt than pleaſure, could not forbear from ſaying to him, What? doe you not make account to ſleep this night? will you never let me alone?</p>
               <p>The poor Bridegroom who was but juſt come to her, was amazed to hear theſe words, and deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of her, what trouble was it he had put her to? ſeeing that he was but now come from the Dance; Dance (ſaid ſhe) why you have danced to ſome tune, for this is the third time that you have come unto me to dance the ſhaking of the Sheets, me thinks that it ſhould becom you better now to ſleep. Her Husband hearing thoſe words was much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and forgot all other things that he had to do, to underſtand the truth of this Myſtery; and when ſhe had given him an account of it, he immediately ſuſpected that it was the Friers who were lodged the very next door to him; wherefore riſing from his Bed he preſently did goe unto their Chamber, and finding them not there, he called out ſo loud for help, that all his friends aſſembled themſelves, who having underſtood the fact did aſſiſt him with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, and Lanthorns, and all the dogs of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage to find out the Friers; And when he perceived them not in the dwelling houſe, nor the out-houſes, their diligence made ſuch a diſpatch that they did apprehend them amongſt the Vines, and did uſe them as they had deſerved, for having ſoundly bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, they did cut their Leggs and their Arms,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:119929:216"/>and did leave them in the Vines to the protection of <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> to whom they were better Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples than to Saint <hi>Francis.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>Do not wonder (Ladies) if theſe Religious people ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from our common faſhion and manner of living doe act thoſe things which other Men are aſhamed to perform. You may wonder that they do no worſe, when God doth draw back his hand from them, for the habit doth not make a Monk, but oftentimes doth undo him through pride and arrogance. Good God, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>can we find no other Subjects for theſe Accounts but Monks and Friers only.</hi> Emarſuite <hi>ſaid, if in theſe Hiſtories we spare not Ladies, Princes, and Gentlemen, me thinks that the Monks ſhould not be displeaſed that we make them our Subjects, for the greateſt part of them is ſo unprofitable, that if they did not ſome evil by which they might be remembred, there is neither Man nor woman that would make the leaſt mention of them. It is vulgarly spoken, that it is better to do ill than to do nothing at all; and this Packet of our Accounts will ſeem more delightful, the more it is filled with different Subjects. If you will promiſe not to be angry with me, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>I will give you an Account of two Perſons ſo burning in the flames of love, that you will excuſe the poor Friers, and ſay that they did but take their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity where they could find it, but this Lady who had enough to ſeed on, did too fondly ſeek after freſh Diet.

               <head>The Subtilty of a Counteſs, privatly to have her pleaſure of Men; And how ſhe was diſcovered.</head>
               <head type="sub">The ninth Novell.</head>
               <p>IN the Court of a King of <hi>France,</hi> named <hi>Charles,</hi> I will not tell you what <hi>Charles,</hi> for the honour of the Lady of whom I ſpeak, neither will I name her to you by her own Name, but ſhe was a Counteſſe of a great houſe, but not a <hi>French</hi>-woman by her birth; And as all new things do pleaſe, this Lady at her firſt comming to the Court, as well for the Novelty and Faſhion of her Garments, as for her wealth, with which ſhe abounded, was much looked upon by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one: And although ſhe was none of the moſt beautifull, yet ſhe had ſo great a grace and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it was impoſſible to have more. Such was her language, and her gravity, that there was not a Man in the Court who was not afraid to ſpeak unto her, unleſs it were the King, who loved her intirely. And to expreſs himſelf more privatly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, he gave her Husband a Commiſſion, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed him in the affairs of ſtate, where he continued a long time, and during his abſence the King made very much of his Wife. Many Courtiers and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Honour, who perceived that the King their Maſter was gallantly entertained by her, did aſſume the boldneſſe to ſpeak unto her, and amongſt others, one named <hi>Aſtillon,</hi> who was a Gentleman of her own temper, and of a great grace and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but ſhe checked him with ſo great a gravity, threatning him that ſhe would acquaint the King his Maſter with it, that he began to be afraid, but being a Souldier, and not accuſtomed to fear, he did ſo aſſure her of his affection, and did follow her ſo cloſely, that ſhe conſented to ſpeak unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and inſtructed him in what manner he ſhould
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:119929:217"/>come unto her Chamber, which he did not fail to put in execution. And that the King might have no ſuſpition of it, he demanded leave of the King to go into the Country, and ſo he departed from the Court. On the firſt dayes Journey he left all his followers behind him, and came at night to receive the fruit of thoſe promiſes which the Counteſſe had made unto him, and found her as good as her word; wherewith he was ſo ſatisfied, that he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſtay there ſeven or eight dayes, ſhut up in a Wardrobe, and during that time he never did go forth of it, living only upon Reſtoratives.</p>
               <p>During thoſe eight days in which there he ſtayed, there came another Courtier, one of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to make love unto the Counteſs, whoſe Name was <hi>Duraceir.</hi> At the firſt ſhe entertained him with the ſame words, as ſhe did young <hi>Aſtillon,</hi> and was rather more rough in her language, but at the laſt ſhe looked on him every day more ſmilingly than other: And when the Day came that ſhe did give leave to her firſt priſoner to depart, ſhe did put the ſecond into his place; and during the time that he was there, another of their Companions, called <hi>Valcebron,</hi> did court her in the ſame manner as the two former, and after him there came two or three others, who all did partake in that ſweet priſon.</p>
               <p>This life continued a long time, and was ſo finely carried, that they underſtood nothing of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers adventures: And although they knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough the love which one another did bear unto her, yet every one thought, that none of them all had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Intereſt in her, but himſelf alone, and every one flouted his Companion for being diſappointed in his great expectation. One day when the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men above-named were at Dinner, where they were all very merry, they did begin to diſcourſe of their fortunes, and of the priſons they had been in during the wars; but <hi>Valcebron,</hi> who was unable
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:119929:218"/>for any time to conceal ſo good a fortune as that which they had all enjoyed, did ſay unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, I know not what priſons you have been in, but as for my ſelf, for the love of a priſon in which I have been, I will ſpeak the praiſes of it during my life above all others, For I doe believe there is no pleaſure in this World that can be compared to that where I have been Priſoner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſtillon,</hi> who was the firſt Priſoner, did ſuſpect what Priſon it was he meant, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Valcebron,</hi> Under what Jaolor, or Jaoloreſſe were you ſo well u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that you ſo much extol your Priſon? <hi>Valcebron</hi> made anſwer to him, Whoſoever was the Jaolor, the Priſon was ſo agreeable unto me, that I doe wiſh with all my heart that it had continued longer, for I was never better uſed, nor more contented. <hi>Duraceir</hi> who was a man but of few words, did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand well enough that they diſcourſed of that Priſon in which he had his ſhare as well as they, and ſaid unto <hi>Valcebron,</hi> With what Viands were you nouriſhed in that Priſon which ſo highly you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend? The King, ſaid <hi>Valcebron</hi> did not feed on better nor more nouriſhing. Nevertheleſſe it were requiſite, ſaid <hi>Duraceir,</hi> I ſhould know, if the Perſon whoſoever it were that kept you Priſoner did not make you earn your bread. <hi>Valcebron,</hi> who doubted he was underſtood, could not contain himſelf, but ſaid, Ha! Is it ſo? O Wit and grave diſcretion, I find now that I have Companions, where I thought I had been alone. <hi>Aſtillon</hi> obſerving the Debate, and knowing that he had a part in the priſon as well as the reſt, could not forbear from laughing, and ſaid, We all follow one Maſter, and are the Friends and Companions of his youth. If we have been Companions together in any bad fortune, we have occaſion to laugh at it, but to know whether that be true or no which I ſuggeſt unto my ſelf, I muſt beſeech you to give me leave to put an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory or two unto you, and that you will be
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:119929:218"/>pleaſed to confeſſe the Truth unto me, for if that is befallen us as I doe conjecture, it will be one of the moſt pleaſant adventures that ever in any place was heard of.</p>
               <p>They all did ſwear to ſpeak the truth, ſince it was ſo that they muſt not deny it. He ſaid unto them, I will tell you my fortune, and you ſhall all anſwer me, I, or no, if yours be not like unto mine. They did all accord unto him, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he began. In the firſt place I demanded leave of the King to take a Journey into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They all anſwered, And ſo did all we. When I was two miles from the Court, I left all my follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers behind me, and did goe to render my ſelf Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They all made anſwer, We did all the like. I ſtayed, ſaid <hi>Aſtillon,</hi> ſeven or eight days locked up in a Wardrope, where I did feed on nothing but Reſtoratives, and the moſt pleaſant Viands which ever I taſted, and at the end of eight days, they who kept me priſoner did let me goe, but far more feeble than when I came. They did all ſwear, The very ſame was all their fortunes. My impriſonment, ſaid <hi>Aſtillon,</hi> did end on ſuch a day; And then did mine begin, ſaid <hi>Duraceir,</hi> it was on the very ſame day in which yours did end, and it continued eight days. <hi>Valcebron</hi> loſt all patience, and did begin to ſwear s'Blood! For ought that I can ſee I am the third, who thought my ſelf to be the firſt and only man, but I came in on ſuch a day, and did goe forth on ſuch a day. The other three who were at table, did ſwear, that one after another they all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the ſame order. Since it is ſo, ſaid <hi>Aſtillon,</hi> I will inform you with the condition of my Jaolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe. She is a married Woman, and her Husband is far off imployed in the Kings ſervice. They all made anſwer, It is the very ſame woman. Well then, ſaid <hi>Aſtillon,</hi> to put our ſelves out of all doubt, I who was the firſt of all inrolled will firſt of all name her, it is Madam the Counteſſe, who is ſo
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:119929:219"/>full of ſtate, forſooth, that in gaining her love, I thought I had overcom <hi>Caeſar.</hi> May all the Devils take the Slut who hath put us all to ſo much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and made us to think our ſelves ſo happy in having a place in her affection. There was never any like unto her, for when ſhe had one in her Cage, ſhe was looking about, and dealing for another, to keep her ſelf always in exerciſe. I had rather be dead, than let her go ſo without any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at all.</p>
               <p>They demanded of <hi>Duraceir</hi> what he thought of it, and what puniſhment ſhe ought to have, proteſting they would be all ready to inflict it on her. In my opinion (ſaid he) we ought to acquaint the King our Maſter with it, who doth reverence her like a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe. We will not do ſo, (ſaid <hi>Aſtillon</hi>) we have means enough in our own hands to be revenged on her, without appealing to our Maſter: We ſhall find her to morrow morning when ſhe goes to Maſs, at what time we will all be ready to attend her, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one with a little hoop, or collar of Iron about his neck; and when ſhe enters into the Church, we will all together preſent our ſelves at once before her, and ſalute her as we ſhall think ſitting. This Counſel was approved by all the Company, and every one provided himſelf with a Collar of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
               <p>The morning being come, they being all cloathed in black, and every one with a Hoop of Iron about his neck in the faſhion of a Collar, they came to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Counteſſe as ſhe was going to Church, who when ſhe beheld them ſo ſtrangely accoutred, began to laugh, and ſaid unto them, From whence come theſe dolorous people? Madam (ſaid <hi>Aſtillon</hi>) We your poor ſlaves and priſoners are come to do you ſervice. The Counteſs making a ſemblance as if ſhe knew nothing at all, did ſay unto them, You are not my priſoners, neither can I underſtand what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion you have to do ſervice to me, more than to
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:119929:219"/>any other: whereupon <hi>Valtebron</hi> advanced himſelf more near unto her, and ſaid, Since we have fed ſo long on your Bread, we ſhould be ungratefull, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, if we ſhould not do you ſervice. She did put ſo good a countenance upon it, pretending to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nothing at all, that ſhe thought with her bold diſſimulation to have amazed them; but they followed their proceſs ſo cloſely, that ſhe perceived that the buſineſſe was diſcovered. Wherefore incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently ſhe did find an expedient to deceive them; for ſhe who had loſt her honour and her Conſcience, would not receive the ſhame which they thought to have brought upon her, who, but as one who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred her pleaſure above all the honour of the world, did make nothing of what they ſaid, and did not alter her Countenance at all, at which they were all aſtoniſhed, ſeeing that they had brought upon themſelves that ſhame which they thought to have done to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, If you find not this Hiſtory able enough to make you underſtand that there are Women as ſubtle, and as wicked as Men, I will look out ſome others for you. Howſoever, it ſeems to me to be ſufficient to demonſtrate to you, that a Woman having loſt her ſhame, is a hundred times more bold, and more ready to do evil, than a Man. There was not a Woman in all the Company who heard this Hiſtory, but made as many ſignes of the Croſs, as if at that preſent before their eyes they had ſeen all their Enemies in Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> Oyſilla <hi>ſaid, Ladies, Let us humble our ſelves, when we do hear of ſuch horrible things; for a Woman forſaken by God, doth render her ſelf like unto him with whom ſhe joyneth. For, as they who do adhere to God, have his Spirit with them; So they who adhere unto the Devil, have always with them the temptations of the Prince of Darkneſs. And there is nothing ſo Beſtial, as a Woman deſtitute of the Spirit of God. Why? what had this poor Lady done, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite? <hi>I can find nothing, I only hear a ſtory of Men who vaunted of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:119929:220"/>their priſon. I am of opinion, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that it is no leſſe pain and trouble for a man in this kind to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his good fortune, than it is for them to obtain it; for there is no hunter but ſounds his horn at the fall of the Game, nor Lover but doth glory having gained the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over his Miſtreſſe. Loe here an opinion, ſaid</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montault, <hi>which before the inquiſition it ſelf, I will maintain to be heretical; for there are more men by far than Women that can keep Secrecies, and I do know very well that there may be ſome found, who had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have no good cheer at all, than that any body ſhould underſtand it. And the Church as a good Mother hath ordained Prieſts who are men to be Confeſſors, and not Women, becauſe they can conceal no ſecrets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is not for that occaſion, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>but becauſe Women are ſo great Enemies to Vice, that they would not ſo eaſily give abſolution as Men, and would be far more auſtere in their injunctions of penance. If they would be as ſevere in their penances, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>as they are in their anſwers, they would make Sinners rather to despair than they would lead them to Salvation; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church hath provived well in all things. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, I cannot excuſe thoſe Gentlemen who did boaſt ſo much of their Priſon, for there was never any Man that received honour by ſpeaking ill of Women. Becauſe the Act was common amongſt them all, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>in my opinion they did well to comfort one another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But they ought not to have confeſſed it, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>for their own honour; for the Books of the</hi> Round Table <hi>do teach us, that it is no point of honour in Chivallry to beat one who is not worth any thing. I do much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that this poor Lady did not die for ſhame before theſe Priſoners. Thoſe who have once loſt it, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>do hardly or never recover it again; unleſſe it be thoſe whom a violent Love hath made to forget it, and I have ſeen many of thoſe to recover their loſt ſhame. I believe, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that you have ſeen thoſe to return who have never ſet foot forward, for an entire love in a VVoman is very hard to find. I am not

               <head type="sub">The tenth Novel.</head>
               <p>IT is not yet a full year, ſince there was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the City of <hi>Cremona,</hi> named Monſieur <hi>John Peter,</hi> who a long time had loved a Lady who lived near unto his houſe, but in the purchaſe which he made, did not receive the Anſwer he deſired, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe did love him with all her heart: At which the poor Gentleman was ſo perplexed, that he retired into his own Chamber, and determined with himſelf no more in vain to ſeek after that, the purſuit whereof did conſume his life, and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to divert his fancy and affection, he did keep within ſome dayes without ſeeing the Lady whom he loved, by reaſon whereof he did fall into ſo extreme a melancholy that it quite altered his Complexion. His Kinſman cauſed the Phyſicians to come unto him, who finding his complexion to be turned yellow, did judge it to be an opilation
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:119929:221"/>of the Liver, and did preſcribe him Medicines for his Recovery. The Lady who had been ſo rigorous unto him, knowing well enough that his Diſeaſe came only by her denials, did ſend unto him an old Woman in whom ſhe truſted, and did command her to acquaint him from her, that ſince ſhe found by experience, that his love was true, and not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, ſhe was reſolved to accord unto him in all thoſe things which for ſo long a time ſhe had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. She had found a way to goe out of her own houſe into a place where privatly ſhe might ſee him.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman who on that morning had been let blood in the arm, finding himſelf to be better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by that Meſſage, than he could be by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or all the receits that could be given him, did teturn word, that he would not fail to come at the hour ſhe appointed, and that ſhe had wrought an apparent Miracle; for by one word ſhe had cured a Man of a Diſeaſe, for whom all the Phyſicians could find no Redreſſe.</p>
               <p>The Evening being come which he ſo much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for, the Gentleman repaired to the place which was appointed, with ſo great a Contentment, that it could not be increaſed. He attended not long, but ſhe, whom he loved better than his own ſoul, did come to find him. He did not ſtudy to make any long Oration, for the fire which did burn within him, did make him haſtily to poſſeſſe himſelf of that, which he could hardly perſwade himſelf that he had in his own power; and being drunk with Love and Pleaſure, whiles he ſought to provide a remedy for his life more than was requiſite, he found the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Death; for in the love to his Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, having forgot himſelf, he perceived not his Arm, from which (the Vein opening again.) the blood did come forth ſo abundantly, that the poor Gentleman was almoſt bathed in it: But he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that his faintneſſe did proceed from his Exceſs
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:119929:221"/>of pleaſure, did think with himſelf to return to his own Lodging. But Love, who had too much uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them together, did ſo diſpoſe of it, that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from his friend, his ſoul did depart from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and by the great effuſion of blood he had loſt he fell down dead at her feet, who was ſo amazd, both in the conſideration of the loſs which ſhe had of ſo entire a friend, of whoſe Death ſhe was the only Cauſe, as alſo of the ſhame that would fall upon her if the dead body were found in her houſe, that not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to do, ſhe and one of her Chambermaids in whom ſhe altogether truſted, did carry the body into the Street, where ſhe would not leave it alone, but taking the ſword of her dead friend, ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to partake of his fortune, and periſh by the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood alſo, in puniſhing that heart which was the cauſe of all this Evil, and forcing the ſword quite through her, ſhe fell down upon the Body of her Friend.</p>
               <p>The Father and the Mother of this young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman comming forth out of their houſe on the next morning, did behold this pittiful ſpectacle; And making as great a lamentation as the Caſe deſerved, they did bury them both together.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this Ladies you may ſee what miſchiefs do attend the extremity of love. This is that which doth pleaſe me well, ſaid</hi> Simontault; <hi>when Love is ſo equal, that the one dying the other cannot live, and if God had made me ſo bleſt as to have found ſuch a one, I do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwade my ſelf, that no man had ever loved ſo perfectly as I ſhould have done. But I am of opinion, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that love would not have ſo much blinded you, but you would have remembred to have kept your Arm better than that Gentleman did, for thoſe days are paſsed, that Men do forget their lives for their Ladies. But thoſe days are not paſſed, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that Ladies for their pleaſure do forget the lives of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. I am of opinion, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that there is no Woman in the World that taketh pleaſure in the
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:119929:222"/>death of a Man although he were her Enemy. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe if Men will kill themſelves, Ladies cannot help their willfulneſſe. So it is, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>that ſhe who refuſeth a piece of bread to a poor men dying for hunger is eſteemed to be a Murdereſſe. If your requeſts, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>were as reaſonable as the poor Mans beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for his neceſſity, Ladies ſhould be too cruel to refuſe you: But God be praiſed, the malady of love doth kill no man but only thoſe who wold die of themſelves that year. I know not Madam, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>what is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neceſſity, but only that which doth make us to forget all others: For when Love is violent we mind neither bread nor any other delicates whatſoever, but only the looks and words of thoſe we love. They who would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to feſt, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>without giving you any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Viands, would quickly make you change your thoughts of Love. I muſt confeſſe, ſaid</hi> Saffredant <hi>that the Body would fail, but the Heart and the good will would ſtill remain. Then, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>God hath given you a great grace, that you ſhould addreſſe your ſelf to one where you find ſo little Contentment, that you muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort up your ſelf with eating and drinking, with which me thinks you may acquit your ſelf ſo well, that you ought to praiſe God for that friendly cruelty. I am ſo nouriſhed in affliction, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>that I do begin to ſolace my ſelf in thoſe torments of which others do complain. It may be, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that your love doth ſo withdraw you from all Company, that no other contentment can be welcom to you, for there is nothing more troubleſom, than an importunate Lover. Nothing, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>unleſſe it be a cruel Lady. I do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>that if we ſhould attend to hear an end of the Reaſons of</hi> Simontault, <hi>that we ſhould bear no Veſpers this Evening. Wherefore let us riſe and praiſe God that this Days work is ſo well accompliſhed. She did begin firſt of all to riſe her ſelf, and all the reſt did follow her, but</hi> Simontault <hi>and</hi> Longaren <hi>did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue all the way to diſcuſſe the Argument, and ſo gently, that without drawing of his Sword</hi> Simontault <hi>did
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:119929:222"/>get the better, ſhewing that the ſtrongeſt paſſion was the greateſt neceſſity. And ſpeaking thoſe words they did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Church where the Monks did attend them. Vespers being ended, they did go to Supper, where they entertained one another with as much diſcourſe as Diet, for the Diſpute continued all the time of Supper, and all the Evening afterwards, until</hi> Oyſilla <hi>told them that it was high time to goe to reſt, and that five days Journeys were adorned with ſuch delightfull Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that ſhe was afraid that the ſixth day would not be like unto it, for it was not poſſible to invent better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, than what were here delivered, and which were not Fictions but Truths. But</hi> Guebron <hi>ſaid that as long as the world endured there would ſomething fall out every day which would be new and worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, for the depravedneſſe of bad men, and their corruptions, will be always ſuch as heretofore they have been, and in the ſame way will be the Goodneſſe of Good men; And as long as Grace and Corruption do reign upon the Earth, they will always fill it with one Novelty or another, although it be written, That there is nothing new under the Sun; But we who have not been called to the privy Counſel of God, being ignorant of the first Cauſes, do find all things new, and ſo much the more admirable, as we have the leſſe deſire or ability to perform them: Wherefore fear not but that the Days Works that are to come will be altogether as pleaſing, and as full of variety, as thoſe which are paſſed, only do you on your parts uſe your beſt indeavours.</hi> Oyſilla <hi>ſaid that ſhe did recommend her ſelf unto God, in whoſe name ſhe did bid them Goodnight; with that all the Company withdrew, putting a period to the fifth Days Work</hi>

            <p>IN the Morning more early than ordinary Madam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> was in the Hall ready to begin her Lecture, of which when of all thoſe her Company were advertiſed (for the deſire they had to pertake in her good inſtruction) they did make themſelves ready with ſo much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that ſhe ſtayed not long for them. She knowing their hearts did read unto them the Epiſtle of Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, which is full of Love. The Company found thoſe Viands to be ſo ſweet, that although they stayed there above half an hour longer than on other dayes they were accuſtomed, yet it did not ſeem to them to be half a quarter of an hour; depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from thence they repaired to Maſſe, where every one of them did commend himſelf to the holy Spirit, that on that day they might ſatisfie
<pb facs="tcp:119929:223"/>the pleaſant audience. After they had dined and taken a little repoſe in their chambers, they reſorted to the Meadow to continue there their accuſtomed Recreations.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Duke of <hi>Italy,</hi> whoſe name I will conceal, had a Son of eight and twenty years of age, who was much in love with a young Maid of a good and honeſt Family, and becauſe he could not have the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to ſpeak unto her as he would according to the cuſtom of the Country, he aſſiſted himſelf by a Gentleman who was his Servant, who was amorous alſo on a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome young Maid a Servant to his Mother, by whom he cauſed the great affection which he did bear unto his Sweetheart to be diſcovered. The poor Maid
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:119929:224"/>thought no hurt of it, but did take pleaſure to doe him ſervice, conceiving his deſires to be ſo juſt and honeſt that he had no other intention but ſhe might well doe the meſſage with honour and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. But the Duke who had more regard to the advancement of his Houſe than to honeſt Love, had ſo great a fear that theſe Loves might proceed to marriage, that he did ſet a very ſtrict watch over them, and he was informed that the poor Girl was imployed to carry Letters from his Son to her whom he loved, at which he was ſo incenſed, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to give an order to prevent it. But he could not ſo well diſſemble his choler but the Damoſel was advertiſed of it, who knowing the cruelty of the Prince, which was as great as his Conſcience was little, ſhe was in a marvellous fear, and addreſſed her ſelf unto the Dutcheſſe, beſeeching her to give her leave to withdraw her ſelf into ſome place out of his ſight, until his choler was paſſed over; But her Miſtreſſe made anſwer to her, that ſhe would know her Husbands pleaſure before ſhe would give her leave.</p>
               <p>Not long afterwards ſhe underſtood the evil reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Duke, and knowing his complexion too well, ſhe not only did give the Maid leave to depart, but adviſed her to retire her ſelf into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery until the Tempeſt was blown over, which accordingly ſhe did, and as privately as poſſibly ſhe could, howſoever the Duke by his Spies was adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of it, &amp; with a countenance pretending Joy, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of his Wife where the Maid was, who thinking that he already knew the truth, did confeſſe unto him where ſhe was, for which he ſeemed to be ſorry, and told her, that ſhe needed not to put on ſo ſad a Countenance, for he on his part did mean no hurt unto her, wherefore he adviſed her to ſend for her back again, for (he ſaid) the report of ſuch a thing would not be good. The Dutcheſſe ſaid unto him, if the poor Girl were ſo unfortunate as to be
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:119929:225"/>deprived of his favour, it were better that for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time ſhe ſhould not appear in his preſence. But he would not receive nor allow her reaſons, and did command her that ſhe ſhould ſend for her again. The Dutcheſſe did not fail to declare unto the Maid the pleaſure and good will of the Duke, of which ſhe could not aſſure her ſelf, but beſought her that ſhe might not tempt her fortunes, for ſhe knew well enough the conditions of the Duke, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pretence he made, it was moſt difficult un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Nature to forgive. The Dutcheſſe aſſured her that ſhe ſhould receive no prejudice at all, and by her Meſſenger made proteſtations to her of it upon her life and honour. The Maid who knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that her Miſtreſſe loved her, and would not for any thing circumvent her, did take a confidence in her promiſe, believing that the Duke would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver violate that ſecurity in which the honour of his Wife was ingaged, and thereupon returned to the Dutcheſſe.</p>
               <p>The Duke when ever he underſtood thereof did come into his Wives Chamber, and having ſeen the Maid, he ſaid unto his Wife, look yonder who is returned? and turning himſelf towards the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that followed him, he commanded them to take hold of her, and to carry her to priſon. The poor Dutcheſſe, who upon the honour of her Word had tempted her out of the place of her protection, was ſo aſtoniſhed at it, that ſhe kneeled down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and beſought him moſt importunately for his own honour, and for the honour of his Houſe, that he would not commit ſuch an Act, ſeeing that to obey him ſhe had taken her from the place of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity where ſhe was; but whatſoever prayer ſhe could make, or reaſons ſhe could allege, nothing would mollifie his heart, nor overcome the heady reſolution he had taken with himſelf to be revenged on her, for without anſwering his Wife one Word he withdrew himſelf from her as faſt as he could,
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:119929:225"/>and forgetting God, and the honour of his Houſe, without any form of Juſtice he moſt cruelly cauſed the Maid to be apprehended. I will not in this place undertake to deſcribe unto you the perplexity of the Dutcheſſe, which was ſuch that a Lady of Honour and of a good ſpirit ought to have, who on the obligation of her faith did ſee her to die whom ſhe deſired to preſerve. But much leſſe may the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of the poor Gentleman be repreſented, who was his Servant, and failed not to uſe the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his endeavour as much as it was poſſible for him to doe, to ſave the life of the Maid, offering to loſe his own life for her, but it would not be accepted, and no pity could touch the heart of the Duke, who knew no other felicity, but to revenge himſelf of thoſe whom he hated. In this manner was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Maid put to death by this cruel Duke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Law of honeſty, to the great grief of all thoſe who knew her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See here Ladies what are the effects of malice when power is joyned unto it. I have heard it spoken, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that the greateſt part of the</hi> Italians (<hi>I ſay the greateſt part; for no doubt there are ſome honeſt men amongſt them, as in all other Nations) are ſubject to their Vices, in which none do exceed them, but I though that Vengeance and Cruelty had not been ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant, as upon every ſmall occaſion to give ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el a death.</hi> Saffredant <hi>ſmiling did ſay unto her,</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garen, <hi>you have given us a true Account of one of the three Vices, I would fain know what are the other two. If you do not know them already, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>I will tell them you, but I am confident you are not to learn what they are. By your words, ſaid</hi> Saffredant <hi>you would make me a very vicious Man. Not by deeds, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>but in knowing the filthineſſe of Vice, you can better than another know how to avoid it. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, ſaid</hi> Simontault <hi>at their cruelty, for thoſe who have travelled into</hi> Italy <hi>will tell you ſuch incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible things of them, that this in the compariſon will
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:119929:226"/>appear but a little Sin or no Sin at all. Believe me, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>when</hi> Rivoli <hi>was taken by the</hi> French, <hi>there was an</hi> Italian <hi>Captain who was eſteemed to be a Gentleman, who ſeeing one dead who was not his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy in particular, but only took part againſt the</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belins, <hi>did tear his heart out of his belly, and roſting it upon the Coals did greedily devour it, and ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent demanding of him what taſt it had, he made anſwer that he never did eat a ſweeter or a more volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous morſel; And not content with this goodly Act, he killed the Wife of the Dead Man, and tearing her young child out of her belly, being almoſt ready to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, did daſh it into pieces againſt the walls, and afterwards filled the two Bodys of the Husband and Wiſe with Oats, and threw them to his Horſes to ſeed on. How do you think he would have uſed this Girl whom he had ſuſpected to have done him a diſpleaſure. It might well be affirmed, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that the Duke was very much afraid that his Son ſhould have married poorly, and that was the reaſon that he would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to have a Wife according to his own mind. You are not to doubt, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that the Nature of them is to love that more than Nature which was only created for the uſe of Nature. Behold, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>the ſecond Sin which I would have repreſented to you, for we all know well enough, that to love money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the uſe of it for which it ſerves, which is only to aid us in our neceſſities, is to make an Idol of it.</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament <hi>added that Saint</hi> Paul <hi>had not forgot their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor the vices of thoſe men who think they do ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and excell all others in wiſdom and humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in which they do confound themſelves, becauſe they render not to God the glory which is due unto him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God who is jealous of his Honour hath renderd them more inſenſible than Beaſts, who believed they had more ſenſe than all other men, and by their luſts againſt Nature they do ſhow that they are delivered up to a reprobate ſenſe.</hi> Longaren <hi>interupted her in her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and ſaid, this is the third Sin to which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:119929:226"/>part of the</hi> Italians <hi>are ſubject. In good earneſt, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>I take an extraordinary delight to hear this diſcourſe, for ſince thoſe Spirits which we eſteem to be the moſt ſubtle, and the greateſt Diſcoverers, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure ſuch a puniſhment as to be more ſenceleſſe than beaſts: We ought to conclude, that thoſe who are hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dejected in their beauty, as I my ſelf am, ſhall be filled with the wiſdom of Angels, and with the grace of God. I aſſure you, anſwered</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>I am not far from your opinion; for no man is more ignorant than he who thinks he knows ſomething. I never, ſaid</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, <hi>ſaw a mocker but he was mocked, nor a deceiver but he was deceived, nor a vain glorious perſon but he was humbled. You do make me to remember an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>which if it had been an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt one I would willingly have recited. It is no great matter, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>for ſince we are met here to speak the truth (be it of what quality it will) I do give you my voice to speak it. Since the place is given to me, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>I muſt take it, and will give you an Account thereof.</hi>

               <p>IN the City of <hi>Alençon,</hi> in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the laſt, there was an Advocate named <hi>Anthony Bachet,</hi> an honeſt man, and a great Lover of a good Breakfaſt in a Winters, morning. One day ſitting very early at his door he obſerved a Gentleman to paſſe by, who was called Monſieur <hi>de Tyrelier,</hi> who by reaſon of the great Froſt which was that morning was come a foot from his own houſe into the City to diſpatch ſome buſineſſe, and he had put on a
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:119929:227"/>long Coat furred with Fox-skins. When he beheld the Advocate, who was of his own complexion, he told him that he had been in the Town almoſt two hours, and already done all his buſineſſe, and that nothing remained but to goe to ſome place of reſort to find out a good Breakfaſt, The Advocate made anſwer to him, that the Breakfaſt was eaſily to be found, but then he muſt pay for it, And taking him by the Arm, he ſaid unto him, Let us goe (my Companion) we may poſſibly find one fool or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who will pay the ſhot for us both.</p>
               <p>By fortune there was behind them an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Boy, a cloſe and a cunning knave, and one to whom the Advocate did bear a long time a ſplean, and by no means could endure him. The Boy thought with himſelf that he had now found a good opportunity to revenge himſelf, and going aſide not above ten paces he found behind a houſe a great Excrement frozen all over, which he did put into a paper, and did wrap it up ſo artificially that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a piece of Naple bisket. He obſerved where the two Companions were, and paſſing in great haſt before them he entred into a houſe, and at the door did as it were by negligence let fall his Naple-bisket which was ſo handſomly made up. The Advocate took it up with great Joy, and ſaid unto his Companion, Monſieur <hi>de la Tyrelier</hi> this cunning knave ſhall this day pay for our Breakfaſt, but let us make haſt leſt the knave ſhould find us in our larceny. And entring into a Tavern he ſaid unto the Maid, make us a good fire, and give us good Bread, and good Wine, and ſome good ſalt bit to reliſh our Mouths this Morning, we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough wherewith to diſcharge the houſe.</p>
               <p>The Maid did ſerve them according to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, but the Advocate having eat and drunk, and ſufficiently warmed himſelf before the fire, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd bread which the Advocate had put into his Breſt did begin to melt, and the ſmell thereof was
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:119929:227"/>ſo ſtrong, that not thinking from what place it came, he ſaid unto the Maid, you have brought us into the filthieſt and moſt ſtinking room that ever I did come into, I doe believe that you doe let your Children doe their buſineſſe upon the place. The Signior <hi>de la Tyrelier</hi> who had his part of the perfume was of the ſame opinion with the Advocate. But the Maid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry that they ſhould lay ſo foul an imputation to her charge, did reply unto them in a great cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, By Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Gentlemen, the houſe is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt houſe, and the room ſo clean, that there is nothing ſtinking in it, unleſſe you have brought it with you.</p>
               <p>The two Companions did riſe from the table, and did goe again unto the fire to warm them, and the Advocate taking his handkerchief out of his Breſt, he found it to be full of the Sirrop of the melted Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which being a bit preſerved to ſweeten their mouths, he did at the laſt bring forth to light. You may well imagine how the Maid of the Tavern that did attend upon them did mock them, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upbraided by them, and what a ſhame it was to the Advocat to ſee himſelf over-reached by an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries boy in the ſame trade of deceit in which he himſelf had all his life been converſant. But the Maid of the Tavern had not the leaſt compaſſion on them, but made them pay their ſhot to a Denier, telling them, that they could not chuſe but be drunk, having received ſuch a fragrancy as well into their Noſes as their Mouths.</p>
               <p>The poor Gentlemen departed with as much ſhame as coſt, and were no ſooner come into the ſtreet, but they ſaw the Apothecaries boy, asking every one who paſſed by, if they had not taken up a quantity of Suger'd bread, made up in a white paper, and they could not ſo readily turn aſide from him, but he cryed out to the Advocate, Sir if you have my bread made with Suger, I beſeech you that you will reſtore it, for ſuch loſſes are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:119929:228"/>to ſuch a poor Servant as I am. At that word the people ſtood ſtill in the ſtreet, and others came out of their houſes to underſtand the debate; And the Act was ſo apparently juſtified, that the Apothecaries boy was as glad that he had been rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of his Suger'd bread, as the Advocate was ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry being guilty of the larceny that he had took it up, but hoping to be even with him another time, he for the preſent did content himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, we commonly obſerve, that oftentimes they are cajoled themſelves who make it their profeſſion to cajole others. If this Gentleman would not have eaten at the expence of another, his Noſe had not drank ſo ſtrong a perfume. It is true, my Account is none of the ſweeteſt, but you did give me leave to speak the truth, which I have acquainted you with, to repreſent unto you, that when a Deceiver is deceived there is no man that is ſorry. It is proverbially ſpoken, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that words in themſelves are never unſavoury, but thoſe things by which they are spoken cannot be ſo eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted but they may ſmell ſtrong enough. It is true, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>that ſuch words ſtinck not, but there are other words which we call filthy words, that are of ſo bad a ſmell, that the Soul is as much troubled to hear them, as the Body was with the evil ſmell of the Sugar Bread of which you have spoken. Tell me, I pray you, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>what words are thoſe which be ſo unclean, that they leave ſuch a filthy favour behind them in the heart of an honeſt Woman? Would it be good do you think, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>that I ſhould tel you that which as yet I have not asked counſel of any Woman whether I ſhould ſpeak or no? By that word, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>I underſtand what terms they are by which Women would be reputed to be wiſe in the concealing of them. But I ask in earneſt of all the Ladies that are preſent, wherfor it is, that ſince they dare not ſpeak ſuch words, that they do laugh ſo readily when they are spoken before them, for 'tis not in my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to believe that a thing which is ſo greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to them ſhould make them laugh. We doe not
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:119929:228"/>laugh, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>becauſe we do hear ſuch wanton or filthy words spoken, but there is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural inclination in every one to laugh, as when we ſee a man to ſtumble, or when a word is spoke out of ſeaſon, or to no purpoſe, as it often falleth out that the tongue doth trip, and one word is ſpoken commonly for another by the wiſeſt and the beſt speakers. But when you men in your ſenſualneſs do on ſet purpoſe utter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean words, I know no Woman of worth, who doth not abhor them, and who will not only forbear to lend an ear unto you, but will avoid your Company. It is true, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>I have ſeen diverſe Women make the ſign of the Croſſe having heard ſuch words spoken, but they have taken a delight immediatly afterwards to have heard them repeated again. Nay, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>how often have they pulled down their Masks, that they might laugh in earneſt with the greater liberty? which ſhews their displeaſure was but feigned. And it were better by far to do ſo, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>than to give you to underſtand that ſuch a diſcourſe was pleaſing to us. You praiſe then, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>as much the Hypocriſie as the virtue of Women. It would be better, ſaid</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garen, <hi>to praiſe their virtue, but when that is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting we must borrow ſomething of Hypocrifie, juſt as we do when we wear Pantofles to make us appear a little higher than we are; and doth it not do well howſoever that we can find a way to cover our imperfections? To tell you what I think, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>it were better ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſhew ſome imperfection, than peremptorily to cover it with the mantle of Virtue. It is true indeed, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that a Garment borrowed doth as much diſhonour him who is enforced to return it, as it did him credit when he did wear it; And there hath been that Lady to my knowledge alive who to cover a ſmall fault hath fallen into a greater. I do ſuſpect, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>who it is you speak of, wherefore at the leaſt doe not name her. And why ſo, ſaid</hi> Gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron, <hi>I do give you my voice, but upon a condition that after you have recited your Account, you will declare
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:119929:229"/>the Name, and we will all ſwear unto you never to make any reiteration of it. I do promiſe you that I will, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>for there is nothing but may be ſpoken of with Honour.</hi>

               <p>KIng <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that name, having reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf into a moſt pleaſant Caſtle, with a ſmall Retinue, as well to ſolace himſelf with the pleaſure of hunting the Buck, as to repoſe himſelf from the troubles &amp; the noiſe of the City, had in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a Pr. as wiſe, as virtuous, &amp; as gallant a man as any in the Kings Court: He had eſpouſed a Lady who had none of the greateſt beauties, but he did love her as well, as a Husband could love a Wife, And repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo great a truſt in her, that if by chance he did take an affection to any other, he did not conceal it from her, knowing that ſhe had no other deſire but what was his. The Prince did fall in love with a Lady that was a Widdow, who had the reputation to be one of the faireſt Ladies that could be looked upon, and if the Prince loved her well, his Wife did love her no leſſe than he, and did oftentimes invite her to eat and to drink with her, finding her ſo wiſe and ſo honeſt, that inſtead of being ſorry that her Husband loved her, ſhe was glad with all her heart to ſee him to addreſſe himſelf to ſo fair a Creature filled with Honour and Virtue.</p>
               <p>This love continued long, inſomuch that the Prince imployed himſelf in his own perſon in all the affairs of this Lady, as if ſhe had been his own Wife, and the Princeſſe his Wife did do no leſſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was ſo exceeding beautiful, many great
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:119929:229"/>Lords and Gentlemen did court her, and were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately ſollicitous to obtain her favour, ſome for love only, and ſome for gifts, for beſides her beauty ſhe was very rich. Amongſt others there was a young Gentleman who did follow her ſo cloſe, that he failed not to be in her Chamber every mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when ſhe made her ſelf ready, and every eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning when ſhe undreſſed her ſelf to goe to bed, and as long as poſſibly he could he ſtayed with her all the day, which pleaſed not the Prince, for he thought that a Man of ſo poor a condition, and of ſo rude a deport, did not deſerve that civil and gratious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, of which in private he often made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances to the Lady. But ſhe who was the Daughter of a Duke did excuſe it, ſaying, That ſhe without diſtinction did ſpeak to all the World, by reaſon whereof her love was the more concealed, ſeeing that ſhe did ſpeak as much to one as to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>At the end of half a year this Gentleman did court her in the way of marriage, and did follow his ſute with ſo much diligence, that more for importunity than for any love, ſhe did promiſe him that ſhe would accept him for her Husband, intreating him that he would not declare it until her Daughters were all married. After this promiſe, the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man without any fear of Conſcience did goe at all hours into her Chamber when he pleaſed, and there was but one Gentlewoman belonging to her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and but one Gentleman that did know of the Contract they had made. The Prince obſerving that the Gentleman did grow more and more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in the houſe of her whom ſo much he loved, did take it ſo ill, that he could not forbear thus to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his jealous heart unto the Lady. I have always loved your Honour as if you were my own Siſter, and you doe know the honeſt diſcourſes with which I did always entertain you, and the contentment which I received to love a Lady ſo wiſe and ſo vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:119929:230"/>as your ſelf, but I doe find that another who doth not deſerve it hath by his importunity gained that, which againſt your approbation I would not deſire; and this is an affliction not to be endured by me, and will prove no leſſe diſhonourable to your ſelf. I doe acquaint you with it, becauſe you are young and beautiful, and until now have lived in the height of reputation, which every day will ſink lower &amp; lower, and being loſt will not be eaſie to be regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; And although he is no ways to be compared to you in Birth or Fortunes, and much leſſe in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Knowledge, or Gracefulneſſe, it would be better far that you ſhould marry him, than to make all the world to ſuſpect you; Wherefore I beſeech you to tell me truly, if you are determined to love him, for I will not have him to be my Companion, and am reſolved to leave you to him for altogether, and I will by degrees withdraw my ſelf from that familiar love which I have born unto you.</p>
               <p>The poor Lady did begin to weep, fearing to loſe his love, and did ſwear unto him that ſhe had rather die than eſpouſe that Gentleman of whom he did ſpeak, but ſhe ſaid that he was ſo importunate, that ſhe could not hinder him from comming into her Chamber on the hour when all the reſt were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to enter. Of thoſe hours (ſaid the Prince) I doe not ſpeak at all, for I can then come in as well as he; and every one may ſee what you doe. But I am Informed that he finds admiſſion into your Chamber after you are in bed, a thing which I do find ſo ſtrange, and which comes ſo quite croſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that I muſt tell you, that if you continue that life, and you doe not declare him for your Husband, you will be one of the moſt diſhonoured Women that ever was. She made unto him all the Oaths that poſſible ſhe could, that ſhe did not eſteem him ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a Husband or a Friend, but for an importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Man as he was. Well (ſaid the Prince) ſince it is ſo, that he is ſo much troubleſome unto you,
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:119929:230"/>I will take a courſe to prevent it. How? (ſaid ſhe) will you cauſe him to be put to death: No, no, (ſaid the Prince) but I will give him to underſtand, that he is not in ſuch a place, or in ſuch a Houſe, as is this which is the Kings, to procure diſhonour unto a Lady, and I doe proteſt unto you upon the faith of a friend, that after I have ſpoken to him if he doth not refrain, I will ſo chaſtiſe him, that others ſhall take example by him.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoke thoſe words he departed, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Chamber it was his fortune to meet with that Gentleman who had been the Subject of their diſcourſe, to whom he repeated all the words which had paſſed betwixt the Lady and himſelf, and aſſured him, that the firſt time he found him in her Chamber, unleſſe it were in the preſcribed hours when Gentlemen are accuſtomed to goe to their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Chambers, he would put him into ſuch a fear that he ſhould remember it whilſt he lived, and ſhe her ſelf ſhould repent for playing faſt and looſe with him. The Gentleman aſſured him that he never came into her Chamber but at the accuſtomed hours with others, and if at any time he ſhould find or hear that he was there at any other hour, he would give him leave to doe the worſt that he could. Some days afterwards when the Gentleman thought that the Princes words and threatnings were forgotten by him, he addreſſed himſelf one Evening to viſite this Lady, and ſtayed with her very late. The Prince that Evening ſaid unto his Wife, that the Lady whom ſhe knew he loved, was fallen ſick of a great Rheume, wherefore the good Princeſſe his Wife did intreat him to goe unto her, and to viſit her for them both, and alſo to excuſe her that ſhe could not come her ſelf, for ſhe had ſome buſineſſe of importance to diſpatch in her own Chamber. The Prince attended until the King his Brother-in-law was in bed, and afterwards he repaired to the Chamber of the Lady whom he loved, to bid her
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:119929:231"/>Good night, and thinking to goe up the ſtairs he found the Groom of the Chamber coming down, of whom he demanded how his Miſtreſſe did, who did ſwear unto him that ſhe was in bed, and faſt aſleep; Whereupon the Prince did go down the ſtairs again, but ſuſpecting that he told him a lye, he looked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, and obſerved the Groom to goe back to his Miſtreſſes Chamber with all the ſpeed he could, he therefore walked in the Court before the door to ſee if the Groom did return again. About a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of and hour afterwards, he ſaw the ſame Groom to come down the ſtairs, and to look round about him on all ſides to deſery who were in the Court. The Prince then conceived with himſelf, that the Gentleman was in the Ladies Chamber, and that he durſt not come down for fear of him, which made him to walk up and down a good while longer, and obſerving in the Ladies Chamber that there was a Window which was not very high that looked down into a little Garden, he remembred the old Proverb, which ſaith, <hi>He that cannot come out of the Door, muſt leap out of the Window,</hi> wherefore he ſaid unto the Gentleman that waited on him, doe you goe into yonder Garden, and if you ſhall ſee a Gentleman to come out at the Window, when ever he ſhall ſet foot on ground, draw your Sword, and claſhing it againſt the wall, cry out, Kill him, Kill him! but be ſure you doe not touch him, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did accordingly as his Maſter had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Prince walked in the Court until it was three hours after Midnight.</p>
               <p>When the Gentleman who was in the Ladies Chamber did underſtand that the Prince was ſtill in the Court, he determined with himſelf to go out of the window, and having firſt of all thrown down his Cloak, with the help of his good friends he leaped out of the Window into the Garden. As ſoon as the Gentleman who belonged to the Prince did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, he failed not to make a great noiſe with his
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:119929:231"/>ſword againſt the Wall, and cryed out, Kill him, Kill him. The poor Gentleman thinking it had been the Prince his Maſter, was poſſeſſed with ſo great a fear, that without adviſing to take his cloake he did run away us faſt as his Leggs could carry him, and met with the Yeomen of the Kings Guard, who watched that night, who were much amazed to ſee him make ſuch haſt, but he ſaid nothing to them, but only intreated them to open the Gate for him, or give him leave to ſtay in the lodge with them untill the next morning, which they did, for on that night they had not the keys. Immediatly afterwards the Prince retired to his own lodgings to goe to bed, and finding the Princeſſe his Wife aſleep, he did wake her, and ſaid unto her, Doe you ſleep Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, what a clock is it? She made anſwer to him, Since I have been in bed, I have not heard the clock ſtrike. He ſaid unto her, It is three a clock in the morning. Jeſus, Sir, ſaid ſhe, where have you been ſo long? I am much afraid that your Health may be prejudiced by it.</p>
               <p>Sweetheart (ſaid the Prince) I ſhall never be ſick with waking, when I keep thoſe from ſleeping who indeavour to deceive me, and ſpeaking thoſe words he did begin to laugh heartily; The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe did earneſtly deſire him, that he would be pleaſed to acquaint her with the cauſe of his laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which he did all along, and ſhewed her the Skin of the Wolf, which the Gentleman that wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him had brought unto him; And having paſſed away a little time in making mirth at what had befallen the Gentleman and the Lady, they did fall both aſleep, and did reſt as ſweetly as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two did travel in fear and ſhame that their loves were diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe the Gentleman underſtanding well enough that he could no longer diſſemble it before the Prince, did come on the next morning very early to attend him at his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ifing, and moſt humbly
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:119929:232"/>beſought him that he would be pleaſed not to reveal him, and reſtore his Cloak unto him. The Prince made a ſemblance to underſtand nothing at all of it, and did hold his countenance ſo well, that the poor Gentleman did not know what was become of it. But at the laſt he had another leſſon than he thought to have heard. For the Prince aſſured him that if ever he did come into that Ladies Chamber again, he would acquaint the King with it, and cauſe him to be baniſhed the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, I do beſeech you to judge, if it were not better for that poor Lady to have spoken freely to the Prince, who did her the honour ſo much to love her and eſteem her, than by diſſimulation to put him to a proof which reflected ſo much on her own disgrace. She knew well enough, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>that if ſhe had confeſſed the truth; ſhe ſhould for ever have loſt his favour, which ſhe would not loſe for any thing. Me thinks, ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>ſince ſhe had choſen a Husband to her own fancy, ſhe ought not to have feared the loſſe of the love of any other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I do believe, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that if ſhe durſt have revealed her marriage, ſhe would have been well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with her Husband, but becauſe ſhe would not have it known until her Daughters were married, ſhe was inforced to make uſe of ſo private a love. It was not ſo, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>but the deſires and ambition of women are ſo great that they can never be contented with one alone. Nay I have been informed that thoſe who are accounted the wiſeſt of all their Sex, have willingly entertained three at one time; One for their Honour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for their Proſit, and a third for their pleaſure, and every one of the three did conceive himſelf to be the beſt beloved, but the two firſt did ſerve the laſt. You ſpeak of thoſe, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>who knew neither Love nor Honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Madam, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>there are ſome of that condition whom you do eſteem to be as honeſt Ladies as any in the Country where they live. You may aſſure your
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:119929:232"/>ſelves, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that a woman who hath a good wit will know how to live when all others do ſtarve for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; it may be ſo, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>but when their cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is diſcovered they had better to be dead and out of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay it is all their life, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>for they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it no little glory to be reputed more wiſe than their Companions, and this Title of being more wiſe, which they have learned to their own expence, doth more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully draw their Servants to their obedience, than doth their beauty, for amongſt thoſe that love it is one of the greateſt pleaſures finely to manage their love. You ſpeak, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>of a wanton and inordinate love; for an Honeſt love never need to be covered. Ha, ſaid</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goucin, <hi>I beſeech you trouble not your head with ſuch a fancy, for the more pretious the Drugg is, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the leſſe vented by reaſon of the indiſcretion of thoſe who look upon the cheaper and more common Receipts which to an unknowing man are all one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore when our love is virtuous we ought the more to conceal it, than if it were vicious and imperfect, becauſe we would not fall into the ill judgement of thoſe, who cannot believe, that a Man can love a Lady for Honor, but that they do love as much for pleaſure, and ſo they do conceive and conclude every to one be like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if they were all in good earneſt, neither the word nor the countenance ſhould carry the leaſt diſſimulation, especially amongſt thoſe who had rather die than think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Evil of love. I do aſſure you</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>ſaid</hi> Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, <hi>You are upon a point of ſuch high Philoſophy, that no Man here doth underſtand you, for you would make them to believe, that Men are either Angels, or Stones, or Devils. I know well enough, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>that Men are Men, and ſubject to all paſſions, but there are thoſe to my knowledge who had rather die than that for their pleaſure their Miſtreſſes ſhould do any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Conſciences</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is too much to die, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:119929:233"/>that word ſhould it proceed from the Mouth of the moſt auſtere and the moſt religious man that is.

               <p>This Gentlewoman did keep in the houſe two Chambermaids, and whenever their Maſter and their Miſtreſſe were in bed, they did either of them take ſome merry book in which they did read for their recreation, and their Chambermaids did all the while ſtand by and hold the Candle, the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of the Maids held the Candle to her Maſter, and the eldeſt to her Miſtreſſe. The Gentleman obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Chambermaid to be more young and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than his Wife, did take a great delight to look upon her, and oftentimes would interrrupt his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to entertain her. His Wife did very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and did well approve that both her Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants, and the Men-ſervants, were ſo officious to pleaſe their Maſter, preſuming that he loved none but her ſelf.</p>
               <p>One Evening having read a great deal longer than they were accuſtomed to doe, his Wife did put her head out of the bed, and looked towards her Husband, where ſhe ſaw her young Chambermaid who held the Candle, but ſhe turning her face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her Maſter as ſhe waited on him, his Wife could not ſee her face but her back only, and the Maid ſtanding directly before her Maſter, ſhe could not ſee him at all; but on the white wall over againſt them, where the light of the Candle did caſt a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſhe could obſerve him, and knew very well by their ſhadowes, which was the Maid &amp; which was her Husband, and could eaſily perceive when they met together, and when they did draw back from one another, and when they laughed, and all the poſtures of them.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman who never thought of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, being aſſured that his Wife could not ſee him, did kiſſe the Chambermaid, at which for the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:119929:234"/>firſt time his Wife was very patient without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word, but when ſhe ſaw that the ſhadowes did often meet together, and did oftentimes return unto that union, fearing they would proceed to worſe, ſhe begun to laugh as loud as poſſibly ſhe could, inſomuch that the ſhadowes were afraid of her laughter, and did ſeparate themſelves. The Gentleman demanded of her wherefore ſhe did laugh ſo, and deſired her that ſhe would make him a partaker of her joy. She made anſwer to him, Sweet-heart, I am ſuch a fool that I laugh at my own ſhade, and for all the intreaties he could make or uſe, he could never get any other anſwer from her. This is that ſtory which you did cauſe me to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when you made mention of that great Lady who loved the Sweet-heart of her Husband.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In good troth, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>If my Chambermaid ſhould have ſerved me ſo, I would have roſe, and ſtung the Candle in her face. You ſpeak too terribly, ſaid</hi> Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, <hi>but what would you think, if your Husband and the Chambermaid ſhould have ſet themſelves againſt you, and ſhould have beaten you ſoundly, for you ſhould make no reckoning of a kiſſe? Howſoever his wife might have done better to have made no noiſe at all, but have let them take their recreation together, It might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have cured him of his Malady. No, ſaid</hi> Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>ſhe was afraid that the end of that Recreation would have made him more weak than he was before.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>And ſo all women of worth and honour ought to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take both of the Good and of the Evil, and the joys and the ſorrows of their Husbands, and to love, obey, and ſerve them as the Church doth Jeſus Chriſt. It were requiſite then, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that our Husbands were to us as Jeſus Chriſt is towards his Church. So we are,
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:119929:234"/>ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>and if it were poſſible we would endure as much, for Jeſus Chriſt died but once for his Church, and we die every day for our Wives. Die? ſaid</hi> Longa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, <hi>In my opinion, you and the other good Husbands who are here do not look as if you were ſuch dying men. I can give you a reaſon for that, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>It is becauſe our Valour is tryed, which our ſhoulders do feel having ſo often born the Corſlet. If you were put to it, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>to wear arms but one moneth, and to lie on the cold and the hard Ground, you would have a good deſire to return to the beds of your own wives, and to make much of that of which you do now complain. But I have heard it spoken, that all things can be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but eaſe, and we know not what Repoſe is until we have loſt it. The good Woman, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>who laughed when her Husband was joyous, had much to do I warrant her to go thorough with it. I do believe, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that ſhe loved her own eaſe better than ſhe loved her Husband, for it ſeemeth ſhe took not any thing to heart whatſoever he did. No, for with a good heart ſhe took that, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>which might have been prejudicial to the health and the Conſcience of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. When you ſpeak in this place of Conſcience, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>you do make me laugh, for he would not have done what he did if he thought his wife would have taken it to heart, and I do not ſee which way the Conſcience can be much prejudiced for a kiſſe. It would not be amiſſe, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>that you had ſuch a wife as he had, who, after her Husbands death, did manifeſt that ſhe loved his Money better than her Conſcience. I do deſire you, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>that you would rehearſe unto us that Novel, for which I do give you my voice. I did not determine, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>to account unto you ſo ſhort a Hiſtory, but becauſe it hath relation to the ſubject on which we have diſcourſed, I will recite it to you.</hi>

               <head type="sub">The fifth Novel.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Saragoſſa</hi> there lived a Merchant, who ſeeing his death to approach, and that he could no longer keep the Goods which he had gotten, it may be, with a bad Conſcience, he thought to ſatisfie his ſin, by giving away all to the poor, without any regard that after his deceaſe his Wife and his Children ſhould die with hunger, and when he had ordered all things in his Houſe, he ſaid, it was his laſt Will, that a good Spaniſh Jennet which he had (and was indeed all his goods that were worth any thing) ſhould be ſold at the greateſt rate that could be, and that the Money ſhould be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto the begging Friers, deſiring his Wife that when ever the breath were out of his Body, ſhe would not fail to ſell the Horſe, and diſtribute the Money according to his Will.</p>
               <p>The burial being paſt, and the firſt tears wept, his Wife, who was no more a fool than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are accuſtomed to be, did repair unto her Servant, who as well as her ſelf did underſtand the laſt Will of her Husband, and ſaid unto him, It ſeems to me, that I have loſt too much already, in loſing my Hushand whom ſo much I loved, without loſing any more of my goods; but ſo it is that I would not be diſobedient to his charge, but doe the beſt I can to ſatisfie his will according to his intention. For the poor Man who in his life as you know well enough would not ſo much as ſpare one Crown for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neceſſity, hath after his death given a round ſum to the poor Friers, thinking it to be a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that will be acceptable to God; wherefore I am adviſed to doe that which at his death he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:119929:235"/>and which is more than he could give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if he had lived but fifteen days longer, and by ſo doing, I will provide for the neceſſities of my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
               <p>But I muſt ſo carry it, that none in the World ſhall know any thing of it; And when her Servant had faithfully promiſed to keep ſecret what was to be done, ſhe ſaid unto him, You muſt go ſell his Horſe, and if any ſhall ask you what is the price of it, you ſhall ſay one Ducket, but I have a good Cat, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mouſer, which you ſhall ſell—let me ſee — I — for ninety nine Duckets, and ſo the Cat and the Horſe ſhall make in all juſt one hundred Duckets, at which price my Husband would have ſold the Horſe alone. The Servant did readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the commands of his Miſtreſſe, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Horſe up and down the Market, holding the demure Cat under his arms. A Gentleman who had ſeen the Horſe before, and had a great mind to buy him, paſſing that way, demanded of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at one word to give him the price of him. The Servant made anſwer, one Ducket. Do not mock me (honeſt friend) ſaid the Gentleman. I aſſure you, Sir, ſaid the Servant, you ſhall give me for it one Ducket and no more; But Sir, I muſt tell you, that you muſt buy the Cat with it, for which I will have ninety and nine Duckets. The Gentleman thought it was but reaſonable, and in ready money laid down one Ducket for the Horſe, and ninety nine for the Cat, accordingly as he demanded, and took away with him his Merchandiſe. The Servant on the other ſide brought home the money to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, who was ſo joyfull at it, that ſhe fayled not to give the Ducket, at which price the Horſe was ſold, to the begging Friers, as her Husband had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, and reſerved the reſt to provide for her ſelf and her Children.</p>
               <p>

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:119929:236"/>as of the profit of her Children? I do believe ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that ſhe loved her Husband well, for ſeeing that on his death-bed he had but ill conſidered of his own affairs, ſhe who did know his intentions, did know alſo to give the beſt interpretation of it for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his Children, for which I do commend her for her wiſdom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

I do not think it to be an error, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>when a man doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute to Beggers what God hath given into his hands; but for a married man to give away all that he hath at his death, and to leave his Family not long afterwards to periſh for hunger, I do not approve it, and in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimon it would be more acreptable to God, if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken more care of the poor Orphans whom he loft behind him, who having nothing wherewith to feed themſelves, and being oppreſſed with poverty, would oftentimes curſe the memory of their Father, inſtead of bleſſing him, when they ſhall find themſelves to pine away for hunger; for God who knoweth the hearts of Men cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and will not only judge according to works, but according unto Faith and Charity who do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive themſelves from him.

I do believe that they do ſo ſettle all their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon their riches, that if they could carry them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them, they would moſt willingly do it, but there is an hour, in which our Saviour will make them more grievouſly to feel their puniſhment, than in the hour of death; for then whatſoever they have done all the time of their lives, be it good or evil, ſhall in an inſtant

And becauſe ſhe heard a fooliſh Monk preach, that it were better to doe ill by the Counſel of the Doctors of the Church, than to doe well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her ſelf to a Frier who was a Confeſſor, an antient Man, and a Doctor in Divinity, being eſteemed to be a good liver throughout all the City, who aſſured her that if his Counſels or his prayers could prevail, he would not fail to provide for the comfort of her ſelf, and of her Daughter. And when ſhe had often and earneſtly intreated him to chooſe a Husband for her Daughter, and ſuch a one whom a Virgin loving God and her Honour ought to wiſh for; He made anſwer to her, that firſt of all by faſting and prayers he would implore the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that God would be pleaſed to conduct him in what he had to do, and he then doubted not to find ſuch a Husband for her Daughter as ſhe deſired; and having put her into this comfort, the Frier depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and conſidered by himſelf what he had to do; and becauſe he underſtood by the Lady that ſhe had gathered together two thouſand Duckets, which ſhe had in a readineſſe to give unto him who ſhould be her Daughters Husband, and that ſhe would take upon herſelf the care and charge of them both, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them with houſe, moveables, and all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations; he conſidered with himſelf that he had a young companion, a handſome and a likely man, on whom he would beſtow the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, and a houſe with all the furniture, and an aſſured maintenance during his life, and reſolved to keep the two thouſand Duckets for himſelf, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his ardent avarice.</p>

I who doe well know his Family and his Kinred, and what is the converſation of his own life, did promiſe him to acquaint you with it. True it is, there is one inconvenience in it, and it is all which I doe know, that ingaging himſelf to aſſiſt one of his friends whom another would have killed, he did draw his Sword thinking to part them, but it ſo fell out that his friend did kill his Enemy, wherefore he, although he did ſtrike no blow at all, was conſtrained to fly out of the Town, becauſe he was preſent at the Man-ſlaughter, and by the counſel of his Parents he is come to this Town in the Habit of a Scholar, where he doth live unknown until his Parents doe give ſatisfaction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Juſtice, which he hopeth will be in a very few days. For this cauſe the marriage ought to be as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as poſſibly you can, and you muſt be content to have him goe every day to the publick Lectures, and every night he may come home to Supper, and lie in your houſe. The Lady being over-joyed did ſay unto him, Sir, in that which you ſpeak I doe find a great advantage, for by this means I ſhall have him near unto me, and every night in my houſe, which I deſire above any thing in the world. To accompliſh this, the Frier brought him to her in a very good Habit, having on a Crimzen Satten doublet, at which ſhe was very glad.</p>

About the break of day, the Bridegroom ſaid unto the Bride, that becauſe he muſt not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing at the Lecture, he was conſtrained to goe unto the College, and having put on his doublet of Crimſon Satten, and his Scholars Gown, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting his ſquare Cap, he came to bid his Bride good morrow, who was in bed, and aſſured her that in the Evening he would come to Supper to her, but at dinner he deſired her that ſhe would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him, and ſo having kiſſed her he took his leave of his Wife, who thought her ſelf to be the happieſt Woman in the World having got ſo good a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

               <p>This life continued a certain time, but as God hath pity on thoſe who out of the ſimplicity of a good intent are deceived, it ſo fell out, that one morning this young Gentlewoman and her Mother had a great Devotion to hear Maſſe, at the Covent of St <hi>Francis,</hi> and to give a viſit to their Father the Confeſſor by whoſe means they were ſo well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the one with a Son-in-law, and the other with an Husband, and by fortune not finding their Confeſſor nor any other of their acquaintance, they were reſolved to hear high Maſſe which was then beginning, expecting the coming of their Confeſſor. The young Gentlewoman being attentive to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and the Myſteries therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, (when the Prieſt turned towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:119929:238"/>people to ſay <hi>Dominus Vobiscum</hi>) was ſtruck with a ſudden amazement, for ſhe thought with her ſelf that it was her Husband, or one very like him, but ſhe would not ſpeak one word, but attended until he turned once more towards them, when ſhe looked upon him more adviſedly, with the ſharpeſt diſcretion of her eye, and ſhe did then aſſure her ſelf that it was he; wherefore ſhe took her Mother by the Arm who was in a great contemplation, and ſaid unto her, Woe is me, Madam, Who is that whom I ſee yonder? Her Mother being ſtartled at it, ſaid, Who? She replyed unto her, it is my own Husband who ſays Maſſe, it is impoſſible that any one in the world ſhould ſo much reſemble him. Her Mother who had not well obſerved him did ſay unto her, Daughter, I pray you ſuffer not ſuch a thought to invade your fancy, for it is a thing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible, that thoſe who are religious and holy men ſhould be guilty of ſuch a trompery; you doe greatly Sin againſt God to believe ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Nevertheleſſe her Mother did more ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faſten her eyes upon him: And when he turned again to ſay <hi>Ite, Miſſa eſt,</hi> ſhe confeſſed, that truly, never two Brothers that came out of one Belly were more like; for all this ſhe was ſo innocent, that lifting up her eyes ſhe ſaid, My God aſſiſt me that I may not believe what I ſee; but becauſe it ſo much concerned her Daughter, ſhe determined to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the buſineſſe further, and to be reſolved in her ſelf of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>When the Evening came, her Husband who did not ſee them at Maſſe did return according to his Cuſtom, and the Mother coming to the Daughter ſaid unto her. We may now know the truth if you will, whether he who ſaid Maſſe be your Husband, or no; For as ſoon as he ſhall be in bed, I will come to you, and he not thinking of it, you ſhall pluck his Cap from off his head, and we ſhall both ſee if he hath ſuch a Crown as he had who ſaid Maſſe this
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:119929:239"/>day. This reſolution being taken was accordingly put in execution, for as ſoon as the ungracious Husband was in bed, the old Woman came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, and taking him by both his hands as it were in ſport, her Daugher pulled off his Cap, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his ſhaven Crown, whereat they were ſo much aſtoniſhed, that it is impoſſible to be more. And immediatly they called their Servants who did take him, and bind him until it were morning, the many excuſes and the fair words he made being all in vain.</p>
               <p>The morning appearing, the Lady ſent to ſeek her Confeſſor, pretending that ſhe had a great Secret to impart to him, who immediatly did come unto her, and ſhe cauſed him to be taken and bound as was the younger Frier, reproaching them for the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible abuſe they had committed: And preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhe delivered them unto Juſtice into whoſe hands ſhe did commit them both, where you may judge, if any of underſtanding be preſent to judge, that they did not goe unpuniſhed.</p>

                  <hi>Here Ladies, by demonſtration you may find, that all thoſe who do vow poverty are not exempt from being tempted with avarice, which is the occaſion of ſo many Evils. Nay rather of ſo much goods, ſaid</hi> Saffre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, <hi>for the two thouſand Duckets which the old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man gave the Friers out of her Treaſury, were goods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make them merry. And the poor Girl her Daughter who had ſo long ſtayed for one Husband, might now by this means have two, and be better enabled to dispute the truth of all Complexions. You entertain always the worſt thoughts that may be, ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla; <hi>for in your own opinion, all women are of your own temper. Madam, by your leave, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>I did not care if they were, provided they were as eaſie to be contented as we Men are. You speak againſt the Truth, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>for I am conſident, there is not a woman here amongſt us but knows the contrary, and moreover you speak directly againſt the ſenſe of the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:119929:239"/>juſt now rehearſed, which was to ſhew the ignorance of poor woman, and the ſubtilty and the ſin of thoſe whom we do commonly believe to be better Men than all others; for you ſhall find, that neither the good Woman nor her Daughter did any thing of their own heads, but ſubmitted their deſires unto the Counſel of their Confeſſor. Howſoever there are ſome women ſo difficult to pleaſe, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that in their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they do deſerve to have Angels for their Husbands; and that is the reaſon, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that ſo often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do find Devils, eſpecially thoſe Women, who not relying on the Grace of God, do truſt altogether to their own apprehenſions, or are ſlattered to a conceit by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to find in this world that felicity which is not given, nor can come from any but from God only. How now</hi> Simontault? <hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>I thought you had not known ſo much. Madam, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>I am ſorry that you conceive me to be no better experienced, for through my defect of knowledge, I perceive that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a bad opinion of me, but for all that (by your leave) why may not I perform the office of a Frier, ſince a Frier hath performed the office of ſuch a Man as I am, Fy, fy, Do you call it an office, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Women? in doing ſo, out of your own mouth you judg your ſelf. If I ſhould deceive a hundred thouſand of them, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>I ſhould not be reveng'd for the torments which but from one of them I have received. I know well enough, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that oftentimes you do make your complaint againſt Ladies, yet nevertheleſſe we ſee you jocund, and in ſo good liking, that we cannot believe you ſuffer ſo much as you ſay you do. But the Author of the fair Lady doth affirm that from bad promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes no good can be expected to enſue. You do allege a notable Doctor, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>who is not only ſtubborn and churliſh himſelf, but alſo makes them all to be ſo who do read and follow his Doctrine. So it is, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that his Doctrine is more profitable to young Women than any Doctrine that I know. But, ſaid</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montault, <hi>If Ladies were without mercy, we might
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:119929:240"/>ſet up our Horſes in our Stables, and let our Armor ruſt upon our walls, and think on nothing but our Country affairs. I pray tell me, if it be for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Lady to have the Name to be without pity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Charity, without Mercy? Without Love and Charity, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>ſhe muſt not be; but the word of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth ſound ſo ſtrangely in the ears of Ladies, that they cannot uſe it without ſome offence unto their Honours; for Mercy properly, is to grant that favour which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and we know well enough what is the favour which Men do deſire: Be not displeaſed Madam</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Simontault) <hi>there are ſome Men ſo reaſonable, that they deſire only but good words. You cauſe me now, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>to remember him, who did content himſelf with a Glove. I would fain know, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>who was that gracious Servant? and for that cauſe I do give you my voice. It will be a pleaſure to me, ſaid</hi> Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>to repeat it to you, for the ſtory is full of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</hi>

               <p>KIng <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh did ſend the Earl of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> as his Ambaſſador into <hi>England,</hi> who was there ſo well entertained, that the King and all his Nobility did love, and highly eſteem him, and many of them did communicate unto him their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs to have his Counſel therein. Being one day at a Banquet which the King had made, there ſate next unto him a Lord, deſcended of moſt noble Parentage, who did wear a Ladies Glove made faſt on his Breſt, as if it were for a Favour; it was wrought all over with gold, and on the joynts of the fingers there were many rich Diamonds, Rubies,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:119929:240"/>Emraulds, and Pearls, inſomuch that the Glove was valued at a very great price.

You muſt underſtand, That during all my life I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Lady, that I do love her, and will love her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my death: And becauſe my heart had more boldneſſe to addreſſe it ſelf on a time and place unto her, than my tongue had to ſpeak unto her, I ſtayed ſeven years without daring to make any ſemblance at all unto her, knowing, that if ſhe perceived it, I ſhould loſe both the means which I had ſo often to frequent the place where ſhe was, by the reaſon whereof, I entertained as much fear as love. But one day being in the field, and looking on her, ſuch a beating of my heart did take me, that I loſt both my Colour and all my Countenance, which ſhe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well perceived, and asked me, How I did? I made anſwer to her, That it was an inſupportable Grief of my heart; She, who thought that it was a Malady of another ſort than Love, did ſhew her ſelf to have pity on me, which made me to beſeech her to put her hand upon my heart to ſee how violently it did beat, which ſhe did more for charity, than for love; And puting her hand which was gloved upon my heart, my heart did ſo beat and torment i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſelf, that ſhe perceived I did ſpeak the Truth: Immediatly I did preſs her hand as cloſe as I could unto it, and ſaid unto her, Ah Madam! Receive the heart which
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:119929:241"/>will break through my Breſt to leap into your hand, from whom I doe hope for Grace, Life, and Mercy, which now conſtrains me to declare unto you that love, which for ſo long a time I have concealed from you, for neither you nor I are Maſters of that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſant God. When ſhe underſtood the words which I did ſpeak unto her, ſhe found them very ſtrange, and would have drawn back her hand, but I did hold it ſo faſt to my heart, that at laſt although ſhe plucked away her cruel hand, yet the gentle Glove ſtayed behind. And becauſe I had not then, nor had ever ſince any greater familiarity with her, I have faſtned this Glove near unto my wounded heart, it being the moſt propper Plaſter which I could give unto it: And I have adorned this Glove as you ſee with all the faireſt Rings, and the moſt pretious things which are in my poſſeſſion, and I will not leave it for the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> for there is nothing in the World which doth me more good than to feell it near my Heart.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> who had rather kiſſe the Hand than love the Glove of a Lady did much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol him for his gerat honeſty, and aſſured him that he was the trueſt Lover that ever he beheld, and ſeeing he made ſo much of ſo little, what would he have done he told him if he had received a greater favour from her than a Glove? It may be he would have dyed through the exceſſe and violence of his Joy. My Lord did readily acknowledge what the Earl of <hi>Montmorancy</hi> ſaid, not ſuſpecting that he did ſpeak it out of mockery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If all Gentlemen in the World were of my Lords hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Ladies might well repoſe their confidence in them, ſeeing it would coſt them no more than the loſſe of a Glove. I know ſo well the Earl of</hi> Montmorancy <hi>of whom you ſpeak, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>that I am confident he would not have lived in that torment, and if he would have been contented with ſo little, he would never have received thoſe great fortunes which he hath

If you had ſo much haunted the Hoſpitals as you have done the Taverns, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>you would not have ſpoken thoſe words, for you ſhall find Women there to bury the dead, which is an office that Men oftentimes (as hardy as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themſelves to be) are afraid to perform. It is true, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that there are none who do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but do clean contrary to that in which they have taken pleaſure, as the Gentlewoman whom I have ſeen in a great houſe in this Kingdom, who to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the pleaſure which ſhe had to kiſſe one whom ſhe loved, was ſeen in a morning four hours together to kiſſe the dead body of a Gentleman who was ſlain the day before, whom ſhe loved no leſſe than the other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was known that ſhe did penance for her paſſed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. We may ſee, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>how all the good deeds which Women do, receive a ſiniſter interpretation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men. I am of opinion, that neither the dead nor the living ought to be kiſſed if God bad not commanded it. As for my ſelf, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>I do care ſo little for kiſſing any Woman but my own, that I ſhall willingly accord to all the Laws that ſhall prohibit it, only I ſhall pitty young people from whom you would take that little contentment, and nullifie the Commandment of Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>who doth give us order that we ſhould kiſſe</hi> in oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo ſancto. <hi>If you were ſuch a Man as Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>we ſhould find it by the operation of that Spirit which did speak in him.

<pb n="432" facs="tcp:119929:242"/>Nevertheleſſe, making ſport with all the reſt, ſhe loved one of them intirely, whom ſhe called Coſin, which gave a colour to his better entertainment: But as there is nothing permanent, their love of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes did turn into Diſcontent, and not long afterwards they would renew their affections more than ever, inſomuch, that (almoſt) not any of the Court were ignorant of it. One day this Lady, as well to make him underſtand, that ſhe took not ſo much delight in any thing, as to put him to ſome perplexity, for whoſe Love ſhe had endured ſo much, ſhe contrived with her ſelf to give him better reſpects than ever ſhe had done heretofore.</p>
               <p>Wherefore he, who neither in Arms or in Love did want for boldneſſe, did begin vigorouſly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe that, which ſo often he in vain had deſired, and ſhe protending that out of meer pity ſhe was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger able to deny him, did ſeem to accord to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and told him, that for that purpoſe ſhe would goe into a Chamber of hers which was three ſtories high, where ſhe knew well enough there would be none to diſturb them, and counſolled him, as ſoon as be obſerved her to go out of the Room where ſhe was, not to fail to follow her, aſſuring him, that he ſhould find her there alone to ſatisfie the heat of that Love which he did bear unto her. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who believed her words, was ſo glad, that he began to be frolick with the other Ladies, attending the happy minute of her going forth, being himſelf immediately to follow her. And ſhe, who did excell in the Arts of Subtilty, (with which all other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do abound) did repair unto two great Princeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with whom ſhe was familiar, and ſaid unto them, If you pleaſe, I will ſhew you the beſt paſtime that you ever ſaw. They who of themſelves were not addicted to Melancholy, did intreat her to tell them what it was, and with whom. She made anſwer, It is with one whom you know to be as honeſt a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman as may be, and withall, as audacious: You
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:119929:243"/>are not ignorant of the many evil offices he hath done me, and eſpecially that at this time when I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him beſt of all, he is in love with others, for which I do endure more grief, than I do make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; At this time God hath given me the means to revenge my ſelf, it is, That I am now going up up into my chamber which is above this, and if you pleaſe but to watch him, you ſhall immediately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him to follow after me, and after he hath gon all along the Gallery, when you ſhall find that he goes up the ſtairs to my Chamber, I muſt beſeech you that you will ſtand both at the Windows to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me to cry out, <hi>A Thief, A Thief,</hi> and you ſhall perceive how red he will kindle with choler, and hear what a noiſe he will make: And although I do believe that he will carry it with confidence, and gracefulneſſe enough, if he doth not make any lowd Complaints, I ſhall believe that he is ſenſible of the Injuries he hath done me.</p>
               <p>This Agreement was not made without ſome laughing, for there was not a Gentleman in all the Court that did quarrel more with the Ladies than himſelf, and he was ſo beloved and eſteemed by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them, that they could not well be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, and were glad when they found themſelves in the danger and circle of his mockery, and now they thought they ſhould all three partake in that Glory and Victory, which only one Woman hoped to obtain againſt him.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when ever they did ſee the Lady to go out of the Room who had undertaken the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, they did begin to obſerve the Countenance of the Gentleman, who ſhifted himſelf from one place to another, and when he was gone out of the door, the two Ladies did follow him into the Gallery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not loſe the ſight of him, He, who ſuſpected nothing, did caſt his cloak over his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and muffled himſelf with it, becauſe he would not be ſeen, and firſt of all he did go down the ſtairs
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:119929:243"/>into the Court, and afterwards came up again, and deſcrying one whom he would not have a Witneſſe of what he was about to doe, he did goe down the Stairs into the Court again, and immediately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round about did come up on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>The two Ladies did obſerve him all the while, and he thought himſelf to be undiſcovered by any. When he came to the Stairs on which he was to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to the Chamber of the Lady, the two Ladies did begin to put their heads out of the Window, and immediately they perceived the Lady in her own Chamber, who putting her Head out of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as far as ever ſhe could ſtretch it, did cry out, a Thief, a Thief, and the two Ladies at the Window below, bid repeat her words ſo ſhrilly, that all the Caſtle did ring with them. I leave unto you to judge in what a choler the Gentleman was, who did run down the Stairs into his own Lodging, not ſo much muffled but he was plainly enough diſcovered by thoſe who knew the Myſtery, who have ſince up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided him with it, eſpecially ſhe did by whom the plot was laid, who told him that ſhe was now reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of him; but he had his defences and his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwers ſo ready, that he made them believe, that he knew before hand of their enterpriſe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and that he had promiſed the Lady to give her only a civil viſite, as for any love he did bear unto her, he ſaid, that was gone long agoe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it was, the Ladies were unwilling to allow his reaſons, the truth whereof is yet under doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if it were ſo that he did believe that Lady, as it is not probable, ſeeing he was ſo wiſe, and full of spirit, that of his age there was not the like in his time, as he hath made apparent to us by his most reſolute death, you muſt confeſſe with me, that the love of virtuous Men is ſuch, that they are oftentimes deceived in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the flatteries of Women. In good earneſt, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>I do commend that Lady in what ſhe hath done; for when a Man is beloved of a Lady, and doth
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:119929:244"/>forſake her for another, ſhe cannot too much revenge the injury, Eſpecially, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>If ſhe were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved; for there are ſome who do love Men without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured to be beloved again, and when they know that they do love others, all they can allege is, that they are inconſtant. Wherefore, thoſe who are wiſe are never deceived with their Words, for they make no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of them, and will not believe any but thoſe only whom by experience they do find to be true, becauſe they will not throw themſelves away upon Lyers, for both the true and the falſe have both of them one language. If all were of your opinion, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may put up their Requeſts in their Pockets. But for all that either you, or ſuch as you are can object, we will always believe that Women are as incredulous as they are beautiful, and this opinion ſhall make us live as contentedly as you would put us into trouble with your temptations. Truly, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>knowing well enough who that Lady was, who did give that affront unto that Gentleman, I cannot find any thing whereof to accuſe her, for ſince ſhe spared not her own Husband, ſhe ought not to forbear her Friend. It ſeems then, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that you know more of her than my ſelf, wherefore I do give you my place to recite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the Account of her.</hi>

Wherefore as often as he could he would retire unto his houſe in the Country, where ſo much Company came to ſee her, that it did not much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh his expences at the Court; For his Wife, in whatſoever place ſhe was, would find ſome means or other to paſſe away the time, either at play, or at dancing, or at ſome other exerciſe in which young Ladies may honeſtly exerciſe themſelves; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when her Husband would ſmiling ſay unto her, that they lived at too high a rate, ſhe would make anſwer, and aſſure him that ſhe would never make him a Cuckold, although ſhe loved to be ſeen in thoſe habiliments which were moſt rich and gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for not any in all the Court did hardly exceed her, which was the occaſion that her Husband did bring her to the Court as ſeldom as poſſibly he could, although ſhe uſed all the means ſhe could to reſort often to it, and to win him the more ſhe would ſo comply with him in all things, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing almoſt ſo impoſſible to be had that he would refuſe to beſtow upon her.</p>
               <p>Finding one day, that all the inventions ſhe could uſe were of no efficacy to perſwade him to make a voyage to the Court, ſhe perceived that he made very much of one of the Maids of her Chamber, and one day ſhe did take her aſide by her ſelf, and did cunningly propound unto her ſo many queſtions, that what by promiſes, and what by threatnings, the Girl did confeſſe unto her, that ever ſince ſhe

               <p>The Lady underſtanding the diſloyalty of her Husband, was ſuddenly tranſported with the two vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſions of Love and Joy, ſeeing her Husband, who made ſuch a ſemblance to love her, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch a ſhame both to her, and to himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe knew her ſelf to be far more beautifull, and of a more flowing carriage than was the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for whom he would have changed. But her Joy was, that ſhe hoped to take her Husband in ſo great a fault, that he ſhould never reproach her more for her long ſtay at the Court, And the better to arive unto it, ſhe intreated the Maid by little and little to accord to what her Husband did deſire, but upon ſuch Conditions as ſhe ſhould propound unto her. The Maid was very difficult to be perſwaded to it, but being aſſured by her Miſtreſſe both of her Life and Honour, ſhe agreed to ſubmit unto her in all things. The Gentleman continuing his ſute, did obſerve the Ey and the Countenance of the Maid to be much changed, wherfore he did proſecute her more vigorouſly than he was accuſtomed to do, and ſhe, who had her leſſon by heart, did repreſent her poverty unto him; and withall, that if ſhe obeyed him, ſhe ſhould loſe her Miſtreſſes love, and ſervice, having received great hopes to gain a good Husband by her. The Gentleman made anſwer to her, that ſhe need not take any care for all thoſe things, for he would marry her better, and more richly, than it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for her Miſtreſſe to do; and moreover, that he would carry the affair ſo ſecretly, that no man ſhould ſpeak evil of her. At theſe words the agreement was made, and conſidering with themſelves what
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:119929:245"/>place was moſt fit for the accompliſhment of ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a work; ſhe told him that ſhe knew no place more convenient for the buſineſſe, nor more far from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, than the little Lodge that was in the Parke, where there was a Bed, and a Chamber fit for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman, who would have diſliked no place, was very well contented that ſhe had nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated that, and the time ſeemed very tedious to him, untill the day and the hour were come. The Maid failed not in the performance of the promiſe which ſhe made unto her Miſtreſſe, and acquainted her all along with the whole diſcourſe of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which was to be the next day after dinner, and aſſured her, that on the hour when ſhe was to go, ſhe would not fail to give her ſome notice of it. Her Miſtreſſe did heartily intreat her to take a great care what ſhe was about to do, and that ſhe herſelf would not fail to be there at the hour to keep her from the danger into which ſhe had put her ſelf by obeying her Counſels. Moreover, to her aſſurances ſhe added oathes, and charged her not to be fearful of any thing, and that ſhe never would forſake her, but preſerve her both then, and for the time to come, from the fury of her Husband.</p>
               <p>The next day being come, the Gentleman made himſelf as fine as might be, and after Dinner be ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to make more of his Wife than he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do. But this, (becauſe ſhe knew of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions) was not very agreeable to her, but ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled her thoughts ſo well, that he perceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Dinner being done, ſhe demanded of him at what ſport he would pleaſe to paſs away the time? He made anſwer to her, that for the preſent he could deviſe no better paſtime, than to play at Cards. Immediately they did begin to play, but ſhe would not play her ſelf, but ſaid, It would be pleaſure enough for her to look upon the Gameſters. As he began to ſet himſelf to play, he fayled not to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:119929:246"/>ſpeak unto the Maid not to forget her promiſe, and when he was at play ſhe paſſed through the Hall, and made a ſign unto her Miſtreſſe of the pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ſhe was going, who took notice of it very well, but the Gentleman did not perceive it.</p>
               <p>An hour after, one of his Grooms did make a ſign unto him a far off, whereupon he ſaid unto his Wife that his Head did begin to ake, and that he was conſtrained to walk abroad a little for his health, and to take the Air. She who knew his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady as well as himſelf, did ask him if ſhe ſhould play out his Game, he ſaid yes, with all his heart, and by and by he would return again. Howſoever ſhe aſſured him that for two hours it ſhould never trouble her to poſſeſſe his place. In this manner the Gentleman departed, and did goe firſt into his Chamber, and afterwards he came down into the Garden, and walked thorough an Alley into his Park. His Wife who knew a nearer way did ſtay a little behind him, and on a ſudden making an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of ſome extraordinary buſineſſe, ſhe did give her Cards to another; And as ſoon as ever ſhe was gone out of the Hall, leaving her high Pattens behind her, ſhe did run as faſt as ſhe could to that place; where ſhe would not have the market to be made without her, and was there in good time, for ſhe came into the Chamber at one door, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her Huband did enter at the other, and ſhe did hide her ſelf behind the hangings, liſtning very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively to the goodly diſcourſe, and the fair and flatering promiſes which her Husband had with the Chambermaid. But when ſhe perceived that he began to commit the Act, ſhe plucked him by his Garment behind, and ſaid unto him. I am too near unto you to take any other beſides my ſelf. If the Gentleman were angry to extremity, you need not to doubt, being as well diſappointed of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which he hoped to receive, as to ſee that his Wife did know that which he would not have her;
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:119929:246"/>therefore truly conceiving that the train was laid by the Maid, (without ſpeaking one word to his Wife) he did run after her with ſo much fury, that if his Wife had not taken her out of his hands he had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly killed her, ſaying it was the boldeſt and the baſeſt baggage that ever he ſaw, and that if his Wife had but concealed her ſelf a little longer, ſhe ſhould find apparently enough that the whole contrivement was nothing but mockery, for inſtead of doing that which the Maid propounded to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he had brought rods to chaſtiſe her. But ſhe who knew well enough the metal of her Husband, did not think ſo well of it, neither would ſhe believe him, and made him ſo many Remonſtrances, that he enterteained a great fear that ſhe would forſake him; wherefore he made her all the promiſes that poſſibly ſhe could deſire, and confeſſed unto her that he had done her wrong to think worſe of her than he did of his Serving Maid; For an honeſt and a fair Woman is not the leſſe virtuous for being not beloved, becauſe ſhe neither ſpeaks nor does any thing that is againſt her Honour, but the Man is he who doth deſerve a great puniſhment, and puts himſelf to an endleſſe trouble to court and follow one who doth not love him, to wrong both his Wife and his Conſcience. Wherefore he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe her that he would never hinder her more from going to Court, nor would ever think ill of it, let her entertain as many Servants to Court her as ſhe pleaſed, for he knew well enough that ſhe did ſpeak unto thoſe rather out of Complement than affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This diſcourſe did nothing diſpleaſe the Lady, for ſhe knew that ſhe had got him at a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nevertheleſſe ſhe did ſpeak unto him clean contrary to her heart, for ſhe pretended that of late ſhe took no pleaſure at all to goe to the Court, and that ſhe regarded his love more than any thing in the World, without which all companies whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:119929:247"/>were moſt unpleaſing to her, ſaying, that a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Woman beloved by her Husband, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning love to him again, did carry with her a ſafe Paſſeport to ſpeak to all the World, and not to be controuled by any.</p>
               <p>The Maid being gone down the ſtairs, the poor Gentleman took ſuch great pains to ſhew her by ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the ſtrength and aſſurance of his Love, that, at the laſt, they departed from that place thoroughly reconciled. And to return no more to the former Inconvenience, he did beſeech her to put away that Maid, by whoſe occaſion he had run himſelf into ſo great a Danger. Which ſhe did accordingly, but it was by marrying her well and honourably, at his own charges. And to make his Wife altogether to forget that folly, he not long afterwards did go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with her to the Court, with ſo brave a Retinue, and her ſelf ſo gorgeouſly ſet forth with variety of rich habiliments, that ſhe had great reaſon to be contented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, This is that which in the foregoing Story did make me ſpeak unto you, that I find it not ſtrange what ſhe did to her Servant, ſeeing how ſhe did uſe her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. You have given us here, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a ſubtile woman, and a fooliſh Husband; for ſeeing he was come ſo far, he ſhould never have ſtayed in ſo fair a way. Why what ſhould he have done, ſaid</hi> Longaren? <hi>That which he had in hand, ſaid</hi> Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>can, <hi>for ſeeing his wife was angry with him, becauſe ſhe knew what he intended, ſhe could not be more, if he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it: Nay, it may be that ever after ſhe would have thought the better of him, having known him to be ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and ſo venturous a Companion. It is well preſumed, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite: <hi>But where will you find one Man that overcame two Women at one time; for the Wife did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her Right, and the Maid her Virginity. It is true, ſaid</hi> Hircan; <hi>but a bold and a couragious Man would not have been afraid to have aſſaulted them both at once. I do believe, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that if he had drawn his
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:119929:247"/>ſword he might have killed them both; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I do not ſee what he could have don. No, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>I would firſt have imbraced my wife, and carried her in my arms out of doors, and afterwards I would have don with the Chamber-maid what I pleaſed, either by love, or by force.</hi> Hircan, <hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>It is ſufficient, and too much too, that you know to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. I am ſure, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that I give here no offence to thoſe who are innocent in what I ſpeak, neither would I maintain an evil Act my ſelf; for (to be ſerious) I do not praiſe any Enterpriſe which of it ſelf is worth nothing, neither will I priſe this Enterpriſer, ſince he did not put an end unto it, rather for the fear, than for the Love of his wife. I do think it commendable, and moſt worthy of true praiſe, when a man loves his wife as God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, but if he cannot love her, I do believe that he is not to fear her. In truth, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>if Love will not make you a good Husband, I have little hope that Fear will ever do it. You need not fear at all, ſaid</hi> Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, <hi>for the Love which I do bear unto you, doth render me more obedient, than the fear either of Death, or Hell. You may ſay what you pleaſe, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>but I have occaſion enough to ſatisfie my ſelf with what I have ſeen and known of you; And of that which I do not know I will never ſuſpect, much leſs enquire. I do find a great ſolly, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>in thoſe Men and Women, who are always enquiring after one another; for, ſufficient for the day is the ſorrow thereof, without ſo much as taking the leaſt care for to morrow. It is neceſſary ſometimes, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>to enquire after things which may concern the honour of a Houſe, to give ſome Order therein, but not to paſs any evil Judgment upon perſons, for there is none but doth ſometimes fail. Many great incoveniences have come to divers men, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>for being too inquiſitive after the faults of their Wives. I pray you, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>if you can give us any Example, that you would not conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al it from us. I can give you a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtance of one, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>and becauſe you will have it, I will in this place exhibite it unto you.</hi>

               <head>A Citizens Wife of <hi>Paris</hi> did abandon her Husband to follow a Chanter, and afterwards counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſelf to be dead, he cauſed her to be buried.</head>
               <head type="sub">The tenth Novel.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Paris</hi> there was a Man of ſo good a diſpoſition, that he made it a point of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to believe that another Man was in bed with his Wife, although that he himſelf had ſeen it. This poor Man eſpouſed a Wife of ſo looſe a government, that it was impoſſible to be mote, which he himſelf would never perceive, but did intreat her as if ſhe had been the beſt Woman in the World. One day when King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth did come to <hi>Paris,</hi> this Woman did forſake her Husband to follow a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who was one of the Muſicians in the Chappel of the King, and when ſhe ſaw that the King was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe reſolved with her ſelf (come what would of her Husband) to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Chanter whereſoever he did goe.</p>
               <p>The Chanter was very glad of it, and did bring her unto a houſe he had, not far from <hi>Blois,</hi> where they did live a long time together. The poor Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band could not be at reſt, and ſearched every place round about the City for his Wife, and at the laſt it was told him, that ſhe was gone away with the Chanter. He who had a great mind to recover the loſt ſheep whom he had not looked to ſo well as he ought, did write unto her ſeveral Letters, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her to return unto him, which if ſhe would, he would take her ſtill to be a good Woman; but ſhe who did take ſo much pleaſure to hear the Charm of the Charmer, that ſhe had forgot the voice of her Husband, did make no reckoning of his Letters, and but mocked at them, at the which her Husband being much moved, did ſend the Chanter word that he would complain to the Church, and
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:119929:248"/>demand Juſtice of the Cleegie if he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn his Wife unto him.</p>
               <p>The Woman fearing that if ſhe ſhould come once into the hands of Juſtice, the Chanter and her ſelf would have enough to do, did think of a remedy worthy of her invention, and feigning her ſelf to be ſick, ſhe ſent for ſome of the chiefeſt Women of the City, to come unto her and viſit her, which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly they did, hoping that her ſickneſſe would withdraw her from her wicked courſe of life, and every one made unto her the beſt Remonſtrances that poſſibly they could, and ſhe counterfeiting her ſelf to be moſt grievouſly ſick, did ſeem to weep, and to acknowledge her ſin, inſomuch that all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had pitty on her, and did firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that what ſhe did ſpeak did proceed from the bottom of her heart, Wherfore ſeeing her ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in Spirit, and ſo repentant, they did the beſt they could to comfort her, ſaying that God was not ſo ſeverely terrible as many Sinners did raſhly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto themſelves, and that he never refuſed mercy to any, who from their hearts, being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the grievouſneſſe of their offences, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it; and ſpeaking thoſe words they ſent for a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man to confeſſe her.</p>
               <p>On the next morning the Curat of the place did reſort unto her, to adminiſter the holy Sacament, which ſhe received with ſo many devout apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that all the good Women of the City who were there preſent, did weep to ſee her penitence, praiſing God whoſe goodneſſe did take pity of ſo poor a Creature; pretending ſhe could live no longer, the extream Vnction was brought unto her by the Curat, which ſhe received with many good ſigns for (to the conjecture of the ſtanders by) ſhe could hardly ſpeak or draw her breath; ſhe for a pretty while ſo continued, and then by little and little ſhe ſeemed to them to loſe her ſight, her hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and all her other ſenſes, whereat they all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:119929:249"/>to cry out, <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And becauſe that night drew on, and many of the Women had a long way to go home, they did all depart. They were no ſooner out of the Doors, but word was brought them that ſhe was dead, wherefore every one ſaying their <hi>De pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundis</hi> did return to their houſes.</p>
               <p>The Curate demanded of the Chanter, in what place he would have her buried? who made anſwer to him, That ſhe gave order her ſelf to be buried in the Church-yard, whither he would have her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the time of night. One of the Maids of the Houſe did put a ſhrowd on that unhappy body, and took a ſpecial care not to hurt it; And thus with many burning Torches ſhe was carried to the Grave which the Sexton had made for her: And when the Hearſe paſſed by their Houſes who aſſiſted to ſee the Unction on her, they came all again out of their Houſes, and did accompany the dead Body to the grave, where they and the Prieſts left her, but the Chanter did not go with them. For when ever he ſaw the Company departed, and that they were gone a good way off, he and his Chambermaid did with all ſpeed digg open the Grave, from whence he took his Friend, more alive than ever, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly brought her unto his houſe, where he kept her a long time concealed. Her Husband, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, and had ſerved a Proceſſe againſt the Chanter, did come as far as <hi>Bloys</hi> to demand Juſtice, and ſound there, by the atteſtation of all the good Women of the City, that his Wife was dead and buried, who did all acquaint him with the good end ſhe made; at which the honeſt man was very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and believed, that the Soul of his Wife was in Paradiſe. And being glad that he was well rid of ſo inſatiate a Creature, he returned with great contentment unto <hi>Paris,</hi> where he married a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, a young, and an honeſt Woman, and (which is worth all) a good Houſwife, by whom he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny children, and lived with her fourteen or fifteen years.</p>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:119929:249"/>
               <p>But Fame which can conceal nothing, doth at laſt bring to her Husbands ear, that his Wife was ſtill alive, and lived with the ungracious Chanter, which the poor Man for a time diſſembled as well as he could, as if he had known nothing of it, deſiring with all his heart, that it might prove untrue; but his Wife, who was a very wife woman, being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of it alſo, was ſurpriyed with ſo great a ſorrow, and anguiſh of mind, that ſhe was almoſt dead with the extremity thereof; And if it were poſſible (her conſcience and honour being preſerved) ſhe would willingly have diſſembled her fortune. But that was impoſſible; For the Rumor thereof being ſpread abroad, the Church did begin to look after them, and gave order at firſt, that the good Man and his Wife ſhould live aſunder, until the truth of the fact was more fully known. Whereupon the poor Man, to his great grief, was conſtrained to abandon his good Wife, to ſeek after his bad one, and came to <hi>Bloys,</hi> a little after that King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that Name was made King, in which City he found Qu. <hi>Claudia,</hi> and Madam the Regent, before whom he made his complaint, demanding her, whom with all his heart he deſired not to have ſeen, (but it muſt be ſo, whether he would or no; for which he had the pity of all the Inhabitants.) And when his Wife was preſented to him, ſhe a long time would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that it was not her Husband, but ſome Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, which he alſo (if poſſibly he could) would have believed with all his heart. She being more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful than aſhamed, did profeſſe openly, That ſhe had rather die, than return to <hi>Paris</hi> with him, at which he was much diſcontented. But the Ladies before whom ſhe did expreſs her ſelf ſo boldly, did ſo much condemn her, that ſhe returned with him; and they ſo preached to the Chanter, and followed what they preached with ſo many uſes of Reproof and Terror, that he was conſtrained to adviſe his Sweet-heart to go home with her Husband, and to
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:119929:250"/>aſſure him, that he would viſit her no more. And thus being diſcountenanced on all ſides, the poor unfortunate Woman was conſtrained to go with her Husband, by whom ſhe was far better uſed, than ſhe deſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, You may obſerve from hence, that if at firſt this Husband had been but vigilant of his Wife, he had never been robbed of her; for a purchaſe well guarded is hardly loſt, and it is abundance that makes a Thief. It is a ſtrange thing, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that Love ſhould be ſo ſtrong, where it is moſt unreaſonable: I have heard it ſpoken (ſaid</hi> Simontault) <hi>that it is eaſier to diſſolve a thouſand Marriages, than to ſeparate the Loves of a Prieſt, and his Lemman. I do eaſily believe it, ſaid</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſuite, <hi>for they who ſo often do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ty others in Mariage, do know of themſelves ſo well to tamper with the kuott, that nothing but they and Death can diſſolve it. And ſince the Doctors do affirm, that the spiritual language is the moſt excellent of all, it doth by conſequence fall out, that the ſpiritual Love alſo doth ſurpaſſe all other Loves. It is a thing, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>which I know not how to pardon in Ladies, to forſake an honeſt Husband, or a Friend, for a Prieſt, be he never ſo handſom, or ſo ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. I muſt beſeech you, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that you would forbear to ſpeak, or to cenſure our Mother the Church; but to believe that it is a great pleaſure to Women fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſecret to ſin with thoſe, who when ever they have don, can abſolve them of them ſins; for there are divers, who are more aſhamed to confeſs a ſin, than to commit it. You speak of thoſe only, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>who have not the fear of God, and who believe that ſecret things ſhall not one day be revealed before the Angels in Heaven. But I have this opinion of thoſe Women, that they deſire not ſo much Confeſſion, as the Confeſſours: for the Enemy hath ſo blinded them, that they ſeek rather to be in a place moſt covert, and ſecure, than to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of their Evil, of which they are not touched with the leaſt Remorſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nay, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>they are ſo far from Remorſe
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:119929:250"/>that they conceive themſelves to be more holy than other Women, and I am confident there are ſome who think themſelves much honour'd to perſevere in ſuch Loves: You ſpeak of ſome only, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>and it appears that you know ſomething of them: Wherefore I ſhall deſire you, that to begin our Journal to morrow, you would inform us of ſomething which you know of this Subject, for this is the laſt time that the Bell doth tole, and hark, the Saints Bell doth now ring in all to Vespers. You might alſo have obſerved, that at the end of the ſixth Novell of this day, the Religious men did all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the ſhade of yonder hedge, and left us to our ſelves to compleat our Hiſtories. Having ſpoke thoſe words all the Company did riſe, and repaired to the Church, where they found that the Monks did attend their coming, and having heard Veſpers, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped altogether, entertaining one another with excellent diſcourſe. Supper being ended they delighted themſelves with walking in the meadow according to their cuſtome, and afterwards every one did go to reſt in their ſeveral lodgings to have the better Memory for the next day.</hi>

            <p>IN the Morning, Madam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> failed not to adminiſter to them the ſaving food of their Soules, which ſhe had gleaned in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Acts, and Virtuous Deeds of the glorious Martyrs, and Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt, as they are declared by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> telling them, That what ſhe read there, did inflame her with a devout deſire to ſee the happy condition of thoſe times, and to lament the Iniquity of theſe: And when ſhe had ſufficiently read and expounded the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that excellent Book, ſhe deſired them to repair to the Church with her, in the ſame Vnion as the Apoſtles did make their prayers, and to demand Grace of God, which is never refuſed to thoſe who do in faith deſire it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:119929:252"/>
            <p>This holy Counſel was well approved by all, and they came into the Church juſt as the Maſs of the holy Spirit did begin, which ſeemed to conduce much to their preſent purpoſe, which made them to give ear unto it with more than ordinary devotion; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at Dinner all their Diſcourſe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the happy lives of the Apoſtles in thoſe Primitive times, in which they took ſo much delight; that it ſeems they had forgot what they had been accuſtomed to do in the Afternoon, of which <hi>Nomerfide,</hi> being the youngeſt, did adviſe them, and ſaid, Madam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> hath ſo long deteyned us with Diſcourſes of Devotion, that we have let paſs the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med hour to retire us for the preparation of our Novells. Her words were the occaſion that all the Company preſently did ariſe, and having made a little ſtay in their Chambers, they failed not to meet all together in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as they had done on the dayes before; And being ſet one by one, Madam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> ſaid to <hi>Saffredant,</hi> Although I am aſſured that you will ſpeak nothing that ſhall tend to the advantage of Women, yet I muſt deſire you that you will rehearſe that Novell to us, which yeſterday in the Evening you did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.
<pb facs="tcp:119929:253"/>I proteſt unto you Madam (ſaid <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffredant</hi>) I ſhall get no diſhonour amongſt Detractors by ſpeaking the truth, neither ſhall I loſe the good opinion of virtuous Ladies by declaring thoſe Errors which Fools commit; for by experience I have found what a miſery it is to be far removed from the Honour of their ſociety, and, if I had been out of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, I ſhould not have been now alive: And ſpeaking thoſe words he turned his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her who was the cauſe of all his grief, and joy, and looking on <hi>Emarſuite</hi> he made her ſo to bluſh, as if ſhe had known that ſhe was the Lady to whom thoſe words did addreſs themſelves; howſoever, he was no leſſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by her, by whom he deſired to be heard. Madam <hi>Oyſilla</hi> aſſured him that he might ſpeak the truth freely to the expence of thoſe only whom it properly concern'd.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the City of <hi>Autun</hi> there lived a beautiful Woman, tall, fair, and of the beſt features in her face that ever I have ſeen. She was married to an honeſt Gentleman who ſeemed to be younger than her ſelf, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe had reaſon to be contented. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he had married her, he brought her unto the City of <hi>Autun</hi> having ſome affairs there to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch which required his preſence. And whiles the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:119929:254"/>Husband followed the Courts of Juſtice, his Wife altogether followed the Church to pray to God for him; ſhe ſo much frequented the holy place, that one of the Canons, a very rich man, did fall in love with her, and did court her ſo affectionately, that in the end the poor Gentlewoman did conſent unto him. Her Husband had not the leaſt ſuſpition of it, and had a greater care to look to his money, than to his Wife. His buſineſs being ended, and the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come that he muſt depart, and return to his own houſe, which was at the leaſt ſeven leagues from the City, it was not without great grief unto the Gentlewoman; but the Canon promiſed her to come oftentimes to viſit her, which he did, pretending ſome great journey, but his way lying alwayes by that Gentlemans houſe, He was not ſo fooliſh, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it well enough, wherefore he gave that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that when the Canon came he ſhould not ſee his Wife, but cauſed her to hide her ſelf, that he might not ſpeak unto her.</p>
               <p>The Wife underſtanding the Jealouſie of her Husband, did not ſeem to be diſpleaſed at it, but reſolved with her ſelf to find out a way to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; for ſhe eſteemed it to be a Hell unto her to to loſe the ſight of her Heaven. One day, when her Husband was gone abroad, ſhe ſo imployed all her Grooms and Chambermaids, that ſhe was left alone by her ſelf, and taking with her what ſhe conceived to be neceſſary, ſhe immediately, without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion at all, but Love only, did go on foot to the City of <hi>Autun,</hi> where ſhe came not ſo late, but her Canon knew her well enough, who kept her locked up, and concealed from her Husband above a year, for all the Admonitions and Excommunications which her Husband did bring forth againſt him. At the laſt, when he could find no other remedy, he made his Complaint to the Biſhop, who had an Archdeacon as pious a Man as any was in <hi>France,</hi> who ſo diligently ſearched all the Houſes of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:119929:254"/>that at laſt he found her whom he thought to be loſt; the Biſhop put her in priſon, and the Canon was cenſured to ſuffer a very great penance. The Husband, finding that his Wife was reclaimed by the Admonitions of the Archdeacon, and many other honeſt Gentlemen, was content to take her again, upon the Oaths ſhe made for the time to come to live a chaſt, and a virtuous life. The good Man her Husband did willingly believe her, becauſe he did bear an extraordinary affection to her, and bringing her home to his houſe, did uſe her as reſpectfully as before, only he did imploy two old Chambermaids, whoſe buſines it was never to ſuffer her to be alone, but the one or the other of them were alwayes with her. But whatſoever good entertainment he did give her, the inordinate love which ſhe did bear unto the Canon, did make her eſteem all her pleaſures but tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And although ſhe was a goodly and a moſt beautifull women, and her Husband a man of an excellent complexion, and of a very ſtrong body, yet ſhe had never any children by him; for her heart was alwayes ſeven leagues from her body: which ſhe ſo well diſſembled, that her Husband thought ſhe had forgotten all that had been paſſed, as he did for his own part. But her deſires could not be contained within the Compaſs of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands houſe; for at the very ſame time that ſhe ſaw her Husband moſt loving to her, and leaſt of all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, ſhe counterſeited her ſelf to be ſick, &amp; ſo well did carry the diſſimulation, that her Husband was in a great perplexity for her, and ſpared for no coſts to relieve her in her counterfeit Extremities. And ſhe played her part ſo cunningly, that both he and all in the houſe with him did think that ſhe was even ſick unto Death, and that by little and little ſhe did paſs away. She obſerving that her Husband was as ſad as he ought to be joyfull, did intreat him, that he would give her leave to make her Will, which, weeping moſt bitterly for her, he did willingly give
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:119929:255"/>way unto: She did give unto her Husband all that which ſhe could give, and deſired pardon of him for the faults ſhe had committed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Having ſent for the Curat, ſhe confeſſed, and received the holy Satrament of the Altar ſo devout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that every one did weep tears of joy to ſee her make ſo glorious an end. When the Evening came, ſhe entreated her Husband that ſhe might have the extreme unction, for ſhe grew ſo weak that ſhe was afraid ſhe ſhould not be able to receive it alive. In great diligence her Husband cauſed it to be brought unto her, and ſhe received it in ſo great humility that ſhe ſtirred up every one to praiſe God for her. After ſhe had received all theſe Myſteries, ſhe ſaid unto her Husband, that ſeeing God had vouchſafed her ſo great a grace as to have taken all that which the Church commandeth, ſhe found her Conſcience in ſo great a peace, that ſhe had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to take a litle reſt, deſiring her Husband to do the like, having great need of it, by reaſoo of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tears he had ſhed, and his long watchings with her. When her Husband was aſleep, and all his Servants with him, the two old Chambermaids who had ſo long watched her in her health, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident they could not loſe her now, unleſſe it were by Death, did goe both to bed alſo to ſleep out their fill; And when ſhe heard them to ſleep ſo ſoundly that they did ſnort again, ſhe did riſe in her Smock, and did goe out of the Chamber, liſtning if ſhe could hear any noiſe about the Houſe, but being aſſured that all was quiet, ſhe took a Staff in her hand, and did goe out at a little Garden door which was not ſhut, and all that night in her Smock only ſhe tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled bare foot towards <hi>Autun</hi> to her Saint that did preſerve her from death. But becauſe the way was long ſhe could not reach to the end of her journey before the break of day. Not long afterwards ſhe looked behind her, and obſerved two Horſemen in a full gallop riding towards <hi>Autun,</hi> and ſuſpecting
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:119929:255"/>that it was her Husband who did ride in the purſute of her, ſhe did hide her ſelf in the Fens hard by, and covered her head with the Ruſhes, and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in full ſpeed paſſing clole by, ſhe heard him to ſpeak unto his Man as if he were in ſome great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity. O wretched Woman! who would have thought that under the covert of the holy Sacraments of the Church ſhe would cover ſo wicked and ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable a deſign. His Servant ſaid unto him, Sir, <hi>Judas,</hi> who was one of the Apoſtles, taking ſuch a Morſel, did not fear to betray his Maſter, think not the treachery of a Woman to be ſo ſtrange; and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe words her Husband paſſed by, and his Wife continued amongſt the ruſhes more joyfull that ſhe had deceived him, than ſhe was at home in a bed of down in Slavery. Her poor Husband ſearched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole City of <hi>Autun,</hi> and found for certain that ſhe was not there. Wherefore he returned by the ſame way which he came, and did nothing but complain of her all the way he did ride, and of the loſſe which he received, threatning her with death without mercy, if ever he ſhould find her again, of which ſhe had no more fear in her Soul, than ſhe felt cold in her body, although the ſeaſon of the year, and the place wherein ſhe covered her ſelf, might give her juſt reaſon to complain of her cold and melancholy voyage. And by the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only how the fire of Hell doth burn thoſe who are puniſhed therein, we may conceive the wonder how this poor wretch coming out of a Warm bed could be able to continue a whole day together in that extremity of cold. Howſoever, ſhe loſt not her reſolution, or her way, for as ſoon as ever night appeared ſhe did begin her journey again, and in the dusk of the Evening when the Gate of the City was about to be ſhut, this poor pilgrim arrived, and failed not to goe directly to the place where her Saint lived, who was ſo amazed at the ſight, that he could hardly believe that it was ſhe, but having
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:119929:256"/>diligently examined her with his eye, and found by his hand that ſhe had fleſh and bones, which a Spirit hath not, he did reſt himſelf aſſur'd that it was no Apparition, and immediately did comply ſo well with her, that ſhe after wards did continue with him fifteen years together.</p>
               <p>Having concealed her ſelf for a certain time, at the laſt ſhe loſt all fear and modeſty, and which is worſe, ſhe took ſuch a glory that ſhe had ſuch a friend, that ſhe ſhewed her ſelf openly at the Church before the greateſt part of the Ladies of that City, and before the Magiſtrates, the Officers and others, and had many children by the Canon; and amongſt others a Daughter, who was married to a very rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and ſo gorgeouſly apparelled at her Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding day, that all the good women of the City did murmur very greatly at it; but it was not in their power to give any redreſſe unto it. It ſo came to paſs, that in thoſe dayes Queen <hi>Claudia,</hi> Wife to the late King <hi>Francis,</hi> travelling that way, did lodge in that City, and had in her Company, Madam the Regent Mother to the King, and the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Alençon,</hi> who was her Daughter. A Gentlewoman of the Chamber, named <hi>Peretta,</hi> did come unto the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, and ſaid unto her, Madam, I muſt beſeech you to hear me, you may peradventure do a greater work, than if this day you had heard the Maſſes in all the Churches of <hi>France.</hi> The Dutcheſs ſtayed very willingly to give ear unto her, knowing that from her nothing but good Counſels could proceed. <hi>Peretta</hi> immediately declared to her, That ſhe had taken a little Girl to aſſiſt her in the Queens Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, and having asked of her what was the Newes in the City, ſhe acquainted her with the Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a great many Ladies and Gentlewomen of that City to ſee the Canons Lemman to be ſo impudent as to take the wall of them, and informed her of a great part of her incontinent life.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſſe immediatly repaired to the Queen,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:119929:256"/>and to Madam the Regent, and repeated the ſtory unto her, and they, without any form of proceſſe at all, did ſend to ſeek out this ungracious Woman, who did not conceal her ſelf from them; for ſhe had turned her ſhame and her infamy into a glory, to be the Miſtreſſe of the houſe of ſo reverend, and ſo rich a Man; And being nothing diſmayed, ſhe came without the leaſt alteration of her Countenance to preſent her ſelf before the Ladies, who were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed at her Impudence, that on the ſudden they knew not what to ſay unto her. And after that Madam the Regent had made ſuch Demonſtrations to her, that they would have fetched tears from the eyes of any Woman that was of a modeſt underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhe ſtood before them without the leaſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion at all, and with an extreme confidence did ſay unto them, I muſt beſeech you, Ladies, to take care that my Honour may not be brought into Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, for, God be praiſed, I have lived with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiur the Canon ſo well and vertuouſly, that there is neither man nor woman living that can reprove me, neither ought any one to think but that I live after the will of God; for it is now full three years ſince the Canon hath had any carnal knowledge of me, and we do live as chaſtly, and in as great love, as two Angels, there being not betwixt him and me, the leaſt croſſe word, or contrariety of diſpoſition; And they who ſhall go about to part us ſhall commit a great ſin; for the good Man who is almoſt fourſcore years of age will never endure to live without me, who am my ſelf five and forty yeers of age. You may conceive with your ſelves, that theſe Ladies could not forbear to ſpeak unto her, as ſhe deſerved, and what were the Remonſtrances which every one of them did make unto her, ſeeing her obſtinateneſſe, which could not be molified by the words which they did ſpeak unto her, nor by the conſideration of her own Age, nor by the preſence of thoſe honourable perſonages. Wherefore to humble her they did ſend
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:119929:257"/>for the Archdeacon, who did condemn her to ly in priſon for the ſpace of a whole year, and to feed on nothing but bread and water. The Ladies alſo did ſend for her Husband, who, after their good Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, was contented to take her again, after that her dayes of Penance were expired. But ſhe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſelf to be a priſoner, and that the Canon was reſolved never any more to take her again, did thank the Ladies that they had brought the Devil our of her by the head and ſhoulders, and ſhe had ſo great and perfect a contrition for her faults, that her Husband, inſtead of ſtaying the ſpace of a whole your to take her again, did demand her of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon at the end of fifteen weeks, &amp; ever afterwards they lived together in great love and friendſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You may obſerve here (Ladies) how the chains of Saint</hi> Peter <hi>are by evil perſons converted into the chains of Sathan, and are ſo hard to be diſſolved, that even the Sacraments which do caſt forth Devils out of Mens Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, are by them made the means that they continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in their Conſciences; for the better that things are, they are by being abuſed the occaſions of greater Dangers. Truly, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>this Woman was too wanton and immoderate in her deſires, but it was puniſhment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to appear before ſuch Judges as the Ladies whom you have named, for the look only of the Madam Regent was of that Virtue, that there was no honest Woman but was almoſt afraid to ſtand before her, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her ſelf moſt unworthy to appear in her preſence. Thoſe whom ſhe did ſmile upon did think with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves that they did merit ſome great honour, knowing that ſhe would not look upon any with a good will, but thoſe only who were virtuous Ladies. It had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that ſhe had ſtood in more fear of the bleſſed. Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ament, the unworthy receiving whereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith and Love is eternal Damnation, than of the eyes of a Woman. I promiſe you, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>thoſe who are not inspired with the Grace of God, do ſtand in greater fear of temporal than of spiritual puniſhments.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:119929:257"/>Nevertheleſſe I do believe that this poor Creature was more chaſtiſed by her ſufferings in the Priſon, and by the apprehenſion that ſhe ſhould never ſee the Canon more, than for any remonſtrance that either the Queen or the Lady Regent made unto her. But you have forgot, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>the principal cauſe which did induce her to return, unto her Husband, which was that the Canon was fourſcore years of age, and that her Husband was younger than ſhe her ſelf was: And thus ſhe cunningly took the beſt advantage of all things, and gained in all her Markets; for had the Canon been but as young, you may be ſure ſhe would never have abandoned him. The inſtructions and reproofs of the Ladies would have been no more effectual than the Sacraments which ſhe took. In my opinion, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>howſoever, ſhe did well in one thing, which was, that ſhe did not too haſtily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe her offence, which ſhould be confeſſed unto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and ſhe did wiſely that ſhe spoke ſo little, and did not reveal her ſelf before all the World; for although it be true that ſhe was faulty enough, yet ſhould ſhe have lyed and ſworn unto the contrary, and there were no Man preſent to have diſproved her, even thoſe lies and oaths would by ſome have been believed. So it is, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that a Sin (unleſſe it be with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty) can never be ſo concealed, but at one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be diſcovered, except when God doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it in thoſe, who in their Love to him are repentant for it. And what will you think of thoſe, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>who have no ſooner committed a folly, but will preſently reveal it to all the World? It ſeemeth to be very ſtrange to me, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>and it is a great ſign that their Sin was very pleaſing to them, And as I have told you, He whoſe fins are not covered by the Grace of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himſelf before men, and there are many who take pleaſure to ſpeak of ſuch things, and do make it their glory to publiſh their vices, and others again are ſo fooliſh, that in thinking to conceal they do accuſe themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They conceal themſelves but very untowardly then,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:119929:258"/>ſaid</hi> Saffredant; <hi>but I pray you, if you can give us any example of it, that you will take my place, and declare it to us. Then liſten to my Story, ſaid</hi> Longaren.</p>

               <p>IN the time of King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, there was a Lady of Royal bloud, accompanied with Honour, Virtue, and Beauty, and who could deliver her mind very elegantly, and with a great Grace, and ſhe would alſo laugh as heartily, when ſhe heard any ſubject worthy of laughter. This La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being in one of her Country houſes, all her Subjects and Neighbours did come to viſit her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was as well beloved, as any Woman poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could be. Amongſt others, there came unto her, one afternoon, a Gentlewoman who underſtood that every one who came unto her did account unto her one pretty ſtory or another, to paſſe away the time; wherefore ſhe reſolved with her ſelf, that ſhe would be found as forward as the reſt, and ſaid unto her, Madam, I have a ſtory to declare unto you that will make you laugh, but you ſhall promiſe me not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it unto any, &amp; immediatly ſhe began to expreſs her ſelf. Madam, The ſtory which I ſhall exhibite to you, is very true upon my Conſcience. It is, that there was a married Gentlewoman, who lived very honeſtly with her Husband, although ſhe was but young, and he was very antient. A Gentleman that was her Neighbour ſeeing that ſhe was married to that old Man, was very amorous of her, and did ſollicite her many years together, but he never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:119929:258"/>any other anſwer from her, but ſuch as a wiſe and virtuous Woman ought to give.

                  </gap>lewoman did ſo take away all fear, that he reſolved with himſelf to ſeek out both the place and the occaſion. He did watch ſo narrowly, that one morning when the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Man (Husband to the young Gentlewoman) was gone to ſome houſes that he had in the Country, and was departed from his Wife very early in the morning, becauſe he would avoid the extreme hear of the Day, he came into the Houſe where the young Gentlewoman was, whom he ſound in bed and faſt aſleep, and obſerving that all the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids were gon out of the Chamber (without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the apprehenſion to make faſt the door) he made haſt into the bed to her with his Boots and Spurs on. The Gentlewoman awaking was as ſorry and as much aſhamed as poſſibly could be, but whatſoever remonſtances ſhe could make, he took her by force, and told her, that if ſhe revealed that affair, he himſelf would diſcloſe it to all the World, and declare that ſhe had ſent for him on purpoſe. The young Gentlewoman was ſo amazed at what he ſaid, that ſhe durſt not cry out. Not long afterwards one of the Chambermaids came into the Chamber, whereupon the Gentleman hearing her to come up the Stairs, did riſe up ſo ſuddenly that he had not been diſcovered but only by his Spur, which taking hold on the upper ſheet, did dragg it about the Chamber, inſomuch that the poor young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman having nothing to cover her was left almoſt ſtark naked in the bed: And in ſpeaking thoſe words, although ſhe pretended to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of another, yet ſhe could not take ſuch heed
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:119929:259"/>to her tongue, but it blabbed forth. There was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Woman more aſhamed than my ſelf, when I found that I was ſo naked. Immediatly the Lady who had liſtned very attentively to the Account ſhe made without laughing, could not forbear, at the laſt words ſhe ſpake, to ſay unto her, For ought that I can perceive, you have good reaſon to relate this ſtory, for it properly belongs unto you. The poor Gentlewoman bluſhing did allege what ever ſhe could imagine to recover her Honour, but it was already flown away, and ſo far that ſhe could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, I do perſwade my ſelf, that if it had been ſo unpleaſing to her to commit the Act as ſhe repreſented, ſhe would willingly have loſt the memory of it, and have taken no delight to have repeated it; But as I have ſaid, Sin will eaſily be diſcovered by it ſelf, and ſind eyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſcloſe it, when it is not covered with that coverture which</hi> David <hi>affirmeth doth render a Man bleſſed. In good earneſt, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>this is one of the moſt notorious and moſt ridiculous Fools that ever I heard of, to make others laugh at the expence of her own follies. I find it nothing ſtrange, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that the word ſhould follow the deed, for it is more eaſie to ſpeake than to do. What a buſineſſe do you make of it? ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>What Sin had ſhe committed? ſhe was faſt afleep in her bed, and he did threaten her with Death and Shame.</hi> Lucretia, <hi>who is ſo famous amongst you, would have done the like. It is true, ſaid</hi> Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>there is no Woman ſo pure and innocent who needs not to wear an Apron: But when we take a great displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Act, We do alſo take as great a displeaſure to have it in our memory; but we find it was the pleaſure of this Gentlewoman to make others laugh at the follies ſhe committed.

               <p>IN the City of <hi>Paris</hi> there lived four young Maids, two whereof were Siſters, and of ſo great a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and youth, and ſuch a freſh complexion, that
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:119929:260"/>they were courted with multitudes of Suters. A Gentleman whom the King who then reigned had made Provoſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> obſerving his young Maſter the King to be of age to deſire ſuch Company, did ſo mannage his deſign amongſt them all, that every one of them believing they ſhould be for the King, they all accorded to that which the Provoſt deſired, which was that on ſuch a day they would come alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to a Feaſt to which he would invite his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and in the mean time he did acquaint him with what he had done, who did like it very well. The King alſo did impart it to two other great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages of the Court, who did agree to have their pennyworth in the Market with him. And looking for the fourth Companion for the fourth Maid, there came in by accident a young Lord, a courteous and moſt lovely Gentleman, and ten years younger than any of the other three, he was alſo invited to the Banquet, and made an outward appearance to be very willing to attend upon the King, although in his heart he had no deſire to be preſent at ſuch a meeting; for on one ſide he had newly married a beautiful Wife, who was the Mother of two lovely Infants with which he was very much contented, and they lived together in ſuch peace and unity, that he would not for any thing that his Wife ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt ſuſpition of him; On the other ſide he was a perfect Servant to one of the faireſt Ladies who were at that time in <hi>France,</hi> whom ſo much he loved, and ſo highly eſteemed, that all others did appear but imperfect and deformed to him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that at the beginning of his youth (before he was married) it was impoſſible to perſwade him to ſee or frequent the Company of any other Lady how beautiful ſo ever ſhe were, and took far more pleaſure to ſee her, and perfectly to love her, than in all the delight whatſoever it were, that he could receive from any other.</p>
               <p>This young Lord came to his Wife, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:119929:260"/>her with the enterprize which the King had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, aſſuring her that for his part he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die than accompliſh what he had promiſed; For as when he was in choler there was no man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that durſt aſſault him, ſo, without ſome great occaſion that did provoke him, he had rather die himſelf than commit a murder, if his Honour had not conſtrained him to it. In the like manner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extreme force of Love which begetteth blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in virtuous men, he had rather die than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file his marriage bed by a depraved appetite to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which was the cauſe that his wife did ſo much reſpect and love him, obſerving ſo ſtayed an honeſty to dwell in ſuch a tenderneſſe of youth. And ſhe demanding of him how he could excuſe himſelf, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Princes oftentimes are much incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe men who do not praiſe and follow that which they themſelves do love, he made anſwer, That a wiſe Man hath always a ſickneſſe or a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his ſleeve to aſſiſt himſelf with, at the time of great neceſſity. Wherefore ſome four or five days before I am to goe, I am determined to counterfeit my ſelf to be very ſick, in which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the ſadneſſe of your countenance will much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage me.</p>
               <p>Behold, ſaid his Wife, a good and a holy Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie; I will not fail to put on the ſaddeſt and moſt diſconſolate look that poſſibly I can; for they who can avoid the offence of God and the anger of their Prince, are ſaid to be happy Creatures. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as they determined they performed, and the King was very ſad to underſtand by the Wife the ſickneſſe of her Husband, which laſted but a little, for by reaſon of the intervention of ſome great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the King did forget his pleaſure to follow his Duty in the Government of the Kingdom, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of <hi>Paris;</hi> And one day afterwards having in his memory the deſign which was not put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, did ſay unto the young Prince, What fools
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:119929:261"/>were we to go ſo ſoon out of <hi>Paris,</hi> without ſeeing the four Maids, who (as it was aſſured me) were the faireſt in my Kingdom? The young Prince being then preſent made anſwer, I am very glad of it that you did fail, for during my ſickneſſe I had a great fear that I alone ſhould loſe my part in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, having ſpoke thoſe words the King did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuſpect the diſſimulation of the young Signior, who afterwards was more beloved by his Wife than he was before.</p>
               <p>Parlament <hi>did immediatly begin to laugh, and could not forbear from speaking, And ſhe might have loved him yet better, if he had made this refuſal for the love of her alone, but in what manner ſoever it was, the Gentleman was commendable enough. It ſeems to me, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>it is no great praiſe for a Man to preſerve his Chastity for the love which he doth bear unto his Wife, for there are ſo many reaſons for it, that in a manner he is conſtrained to do it. Firſt of all, God doth command him. Secondly, his oath doth oblige him. And laſtly, Nature, which is ſatisfied, is not ſo ſubject ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to temptation or deſire, as is neceſſity. But the free love whish a Man doth bear unto his Miſtreſſe, of whom he receiveth no delight at all, nor other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but to ſee her, and to ſpeak unto her, and, inſtead of good words from her, doth oftentimes receive a chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh anſwer, when this Love is ſo loyal and firm, that for no adventure whatſoever can arrive, it can be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I ſay this is Chaſtity not only praiſe-worthy but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous. It is no miracle at all, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>for where the heart doth reſolve and devote it ſelf, there is nothing impoſſible to the body. Not to the bodies, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>which are already angelized. I ſpeak not of thoſe, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>who by the Grace of God are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether transformed into him, but of thoſe which we ſee here on earth amongſt Men, and if you pleaſe but to take notice of them, you ſhall find that thoſe who have devoted all their heart and all their affections to attain unto the perfection of ſciences, have not only forgotten the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:119929:261"/>pleaſure of the fleſh, but even thoſe things which are moſt neceſſary for the ſuſtenance of life, as to eat and to drink, for ſo long as the Soul is active within the Body, the fleſh doth remain as it were inſenſible. And from hence it comes to paſſe that thoſe who love beautiful and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ladies, do receive ſuch a full contentment of Spirit to behold them, and to hear them speak, that the fleſh is as it were appeaſed, and taken off from all the heat of her deſires. And thoſe who cannot feel thoſe content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſenſual and carnal, and, being overburthened with the weight and frailty of their fleſh, do not well know whether they have in them a Soul or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But when the Body is ſubject to the Spirit, it is as it were inſenſible to the imperfections of the fleſh, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the earneſt ſtudy of the Soul in the ſtrength of contemplation hath rendred Men inſenſible. I have known a Gentleman, who, to give a demonſtration that he hath loved a Lady more than any other, hath held his naked fingers in the flame of a Candle, his Companions ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by, and looking ſtedfaſtly on the Lady he (not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his hand at all) did burn his Fingers to the very Bone, yet nevertheleſs affirmed that he was not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any pain. In my opinion, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil whoſe Martyr he was ſhould have made a Saint</hi> Laurence <hi>of him, for there are ſome in whom the fire of love is ſo great, that they will not fear that which is leſſe in violence. But if a Lady ſhould have deſired me to endure ſo much for her, I ſhould certainly have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſome great recompenſe, or drawn off my fancy to ſome other who would have been more merciful to me. You would then, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>have your own will after that your Miſtreſſe had hers: like a Gentleman at</hi> Valence <hi>in</hi> Spain, <hi>of whom a Commander who was a brave Souldier did not long ſince give me an account.

               <head type="sub">The fourth Novel.</head>
               <p>IN the City of <hi>Valence</hi> there was a Gentleman who for the ſpace of five or ſix years did love a Lady ſo abſolutely, that during that time, neither the Honour nor the Conſcience of either of them was prejudiced, for it was his intention to have her to his Wife, which ſeemed to their friends on both ſides to be very reaſonable, for he was very handſome, rich, and deſcended of honourable paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and did not raſhly thruſt himſelf into her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but firſt of all did acquaint her with it, and did underſtand her intention, which was that ſhe gladly did accord that he ſhould be her Husband: And this (as I have ſaid) was carried on by their friends on both ſides, who having met together for this effect did think very well of the Marriage, and the rather, becauſe as they thought the young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman her ſelf did ſeem to have a good deſire to it.</p>
               <p>But afterwards, whether ſhe thought to find a better Husband, or to diſſemble the Love which ſhe did bear unto him, or whether ſhe conceived that the greateſt contentment was in a ſingle life, the Marriage day was deferred, and the Company that were aſſembled to ſee the accompliſhment thereof were conſtrained to depart not without a great grief
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:119929:262"/>that they could not put a good concluſion to it, knowing that the parties on both ſides were before ſo well agreed. But above all the poor Gentleman was extremely diſcontented, who had more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently carried his affliction, if he could have found that the fault proceeded from her kinred, and not from her ſelf. But underſtanding the truth, the knowledge whereof did cauſe in him a grief as ſtrong almoſt as death it ſelf; without ſpeaking to his Sweet-heart, or any one elſe, he did withdraw himſelf into his own Houſe, and having given order for the management of his affairs, he did repair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſolitary place, where he endeavoured with himſelf to forget that unprofitable love, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely convert it into the love of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to which not long afterwards he did alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether oblige himſelf.</p>
               <p>During this time of his retirement he received not the leaſt news either from the Gentlewoman whom he had loved, or from any of her friends, wherefore he reſolved with himſelf, ſince he was diſappointed of that life which of all others he conceived to be the moſt happy, to chooſe and take that life upon him which was the moſt auſtere, and the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to him that he could imagine. In this ſad reſolution, which may be truly called a deſpair, he did goe to enter himſelf into a religious houſe, which was a Monaſtery of the order of Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> It was not far from the place where many of his friends had their habitations, who underſtanding of his deſpair, did the utmoſt of their indeavours to divert him from his melancholy reſolution, but they found it to be ſo ſtrongly grounded in his heart, that it was impoſſible to diſſwade him from it. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe underſtanding from whence the occaſion of his Malady did proceed, they concluded to look out ſome redreſſe, and repaired to her who was the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of his ſudden Devotion; who was poſſeſſed with ſuch a ſorrow and an amazement at the news
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:119929:263"/>thereof (thinking that her refuſal for a ſhort time would conduce only to give her a more ſure experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his love, and not for ever to loſe him, of which ſhe ſaw the danger too apparent) that ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly did ſend a Letter to him to give him the aſſurance of her love, and to deſire him to return to take poſſeſſion of her heart which was intirely his own.</p>
               <p>This Letter being delivered by one of her friends with all the remonſtrances of affection that could poſſibly be expreſſed, was received and read by the Gentleman Frier, with ſo ſad a Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and accompanied with ſo many ſighs and tears, that it ſeems he would have both burned it, and drowned it at once. He gave no other anſwer to it, but deſired the Meſſenger to acquaint the Gentlewoman, that the mortifying of his Paſſion did coſt him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o deer, that it had taken from him both the deſire to live, and the fear to die. Wherfore he deſired her who was the occaſion of it, that ſhe would let him injoy a quiet miſery, and ſince ſhe would not content him in the paſſion of his grand deſires, that ſhe would not torment him now, when he was diſpoſſeſſed of them, but content her ſelf with what already ſhe had done, for which he could find no other remedy than to chooſe ſo ſharp a life, and a continual penitence which might cauſe him to forger his ſorrow and her unkindneſſe, and by ſo many faſts and diſciplines ſo to humble and chaſtiſe his Body, that the memory of Death only ſhould be his moſt Soveraign Conſolation, wherefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things he did beſeech her, that he might hear no more tidings of her, for only the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of her Name was a Purgatory inſupportable unto him. The Gentleman returned with this ſad anſwer, and made a report thereof unto her, who could not underſtand it without a grief incredible. But Love (who would not ſuffer her heart to fail until the laſt extremity) did put it into her fancy to
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:119929:263"/>make a ſudden trial, if her ſight and her words could prevail more upon him than her Letters. Wherefore taking her Father, and her neareſt friends along with her, ſhe repaired to the Monaſtery where he had his reſidence, having firſt examined all her Boxes and her Glaſſes for thoſe things which might make her look moſt beautiful, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her ſelf, if ſhe could be but admitted to that happineſſe as but to ſee him once, and ſpeak unto him, it were impoſſible but the fire which had ſo long a reſidence in his heart ſhould grow into a flame as ſtrong as ever.</p>
               <p>In this confidence ſhe entred into the Monaſtery at the end of Veſpers, and ſent unto the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man deſiring him that he would be pleaſed to give a friend of his a viſit in the Chapel within the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. He who did not know who it was that did ſend for him, did make haſt to goe unto the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt dangerous battail in which he ever did fight; He did look ſo pale and ſpiritleſſe that ſhe did hardly know him, nevertheleſſe being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a grace no leſſe amiable than before, Love did enforce her to ſtretch forth her Arms thinking to imbrace him, but the compaſſion which ſhe had to ſee him in that eſtate did ſo ſurround and invade her heart, that ſwouning away ſhe did fall unto the Ground.</p>
               <p>The poor Gentleman who had taken upon him the habit of Religion, obſerving it, and being not deſtitute of Brotherly Charity, did raiſe her up, and did bring her to a ſeat in the Chappel: And he himſelf having no leſſe need of ſuccour, did diſſemble his paſſion, fortifying his heart in the love of God againſt all the temptations with which ſhe could aſſault it; inſomuch that when he beheld her, he did ſeem not to know who it was, or what her deſires were. She having recovered her ſelf from her dyings away, did begin a little to hold up her head, and did look upon him with ſuch fair, and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:119929:264"/>withall ſuch affecting eyes, that they were able to make a rock to relent, and having made a little pauſe, ſhe did expreſſe her ſelf unto him in that ſtuddied language which ſhe conceived moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to withdraw him from the place wherein he was, to which he did give the moſt virtuous anſwers that were poſſible for him to return. But the poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman at laſt perceiving that his heart began to ſoften into compaſſion at the abundance of thoſe tears which rained down from her fair eyes (as one that ſaw Love that hard-hearted little Archer to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at his heart again, and make a new and a more deadly wound with his Golden Arrow) did betake himſelf to his beſt refuge, his Heels, and as faſt as poſſbly he could he did fly at once both from Love, and his late Miſtreſſe, and being reſolved to live no more under their Tyranny, he found he had no other way to overcome them but by flight.</p>
               <p>When he had locked himſelf in his Chamber, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling ſhe ſhould depart from him without knowing his reſolution, he did write unto her two or three words in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> the ſubſtance whereof I have found to be ſo ſignificant that I will not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to you in <hi>French,</hi> becauſe I will not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the gracefulneſſe which they doe carry with them in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue. He did ſend them by a little Novice newly entred into the Monaſtery, who did find her ſtill remaining in the Chapel, and tranſported with ſuch an extremity of deſpair, that if it had been lawfull for her to make her ſelf a Friereſſe, ſhe would have ſtill continued there. But peruſing the Paper which contained theſe words <hi>Volunto don veneſti anima mi qui en las triſtas vides es la mia,</hi> conſidering with her ſelf, that ſhe was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of all hope, ſhe concluded it was her ſafeſt way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ladies, you do here obſerve what vengeance this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did take on the coyneſſe of his Miſtreſſe, who thinking to make a further trial of him did throw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottom of deſpair, inſomuch that when ſhe was willing ſhe could never recover him. Truly, ſaid</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merfide, <hi>I am even ſorry at the heart that he did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the formality of his Habit to espouſe her. I do believe that it would have proved a lawful and a happy marriage. I proteſt unto you, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>I do ſuppoſe that he did very wiſely in it, for he who doth well conſider with himſelf the burthen of Marriage, will find it to be more troubleſome by far than an auſtere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; And he who was ſo much weakned with diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines and faſtings, was afraid to take upon him ſuch a change which ſhould continue all his life. In my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>ſhe committed a great wrong to ſo feeble a man to tempt him unto marriage, which is a task great enough for the ſtrongeſt man in the World; but if ſhe had propounded a diſcourſe unto him of Love, without any other obligation but of Affection, there was no Cord in that which might not be broken, nor knot which might not be untyed; And ſeeing to take him out of Purgatory ſhe would put him into Hell, I do affirm that he had great reaſon to refuſe her. In good earneſt, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>there are too many, who thinking to do better than all others, do oftentimes worſe, and clean contrary to that which they thought to have done. You make me to remember, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>the Story of an old Woman much to this purpoſe, who in her Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did clean contrary to what ſhe intended, whereupon there did ariſe a great tumult in the Church of Saint</hi> Iohn <hi>at</hi> Lyons. <hi>I muſt deſire you, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that you would lake my place, and give us the Account.

                  <hi>You ought therefore, Ladies, to take heed to what Saints you do devote your Candels. Is it not a ſtrange thing, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that on whatſoever Subject they do imploy themſelves, Women do always evil. Is it ill done, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>to carry Candles unto Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers? Yes, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>when they ſet the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of Men on fire with them, for no Good Act can properly be ſaid to be Good, if it be attended with Evil. Was not a little Candle a goodly preſent (beſides) which ſhe brought to offer to God? God regards not, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>the value of the preſent, but the heart of him who doth preſent it. It may be that poor Woman had a greater love to God than thoſe who do offer great torches, for (as the Goſpel affirmeth) ſhe gave out of her Neceſſity. But I believe not, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>that God who is the Soveraign wiſedom is pleaſed with the fooliſhneſſe of Women; for although it is true that ſimplicity is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, yet I do find in the Scripture, that he doth despiſe the Ignorant, and therefore he doth command us to be ſimple and innocent as Doves, but withall to be wiſe as Serpents. For my ſelf, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>I doe not believe her to be ignorant, who, her knees on the Ground, and her Candle lighted in her hand, doth make her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to her Soveraign Lord, acknowledging her own vileneſſe, and that ſhe deſerveth nothing but damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and craving of him repentance, pardon, and grace, and the gift of everlaſting life. I would to God, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>that every Woman did underſtand her ſelf as
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:119929:266"/>well as you, but I am afraid that ſeveral poor Creatures of your Sex have not your intentions.</hi> Oyſilla <hi>made anſwer to him. Thoſe who know leaſt how to speak, are thoſe who oftentimes have the greateſt knowledge of the Love and the Will of God. Wherefore we ought not to judge any but our ſelves.</hi> Emarſuite <hi>laughing ſaid unto her. It was no ſtrange thing for her to put a poor Souldier into a fright who was aſleep. Women of as low condition as her ſelf, have put great Princes into as great a fear without putting any fire to their Foreheads. I do believe, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>that you have ſome ſtory concerning it, which you have a deſire to relate unto us; wherefore (if you pleaſe) take my place. My ſtory ſhall not be long, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>and if I can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to you aright, it will not give you an occaſion to weep.</hi>

After they had ſlept about one hour, they heard the Door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and the Duke drawing the Curtain, did put forth his head to ſee who it was, thinking it was
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:119929:266"/>ſome of his familiar friends who would take him on his Bed with his Princeſſe: But he obſerved a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid who ſeemed to be very old to enter into his Chamber, and to come directly towards the Bed, but the curtain being drawn ſhe could not diſcern by reaſon of the obſcurity of the Chamber who they were, but ſeeing two on the Bed lying cloſe to one another, ſhe began to cry out, O wicked Slut, and infamous as thou art, I have a long time ſuſpected thee to be ſuch as I find thee now to be; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had not ſufficient proof of it, I was loath to acquaint my Lady with it, but now I have found out thy villany I am reſolved not to conceal it one minute: And thou Apoſtate Villain, who haſt pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by thy luſt ſo great a ſhame upon this houſe, as to undoe that poor Girl that is on the Bed, if it were not that I had the fear of God before my eyes, I would tear thee to pieces there where thou art.

               <p>Monſieur <hi>de Vendoſme,</hi> and Madam the Princeſſe, to liſten longer to this diſcourſe, did put their faces one as cloſe unto the other as poſſibly they could, that they might not be diſcovered, laughing ſo heartily that they were not able to ſpeak one word: Wherefore the Chambermaid ſeeing that by her threatnings ſhe could not make them ſtir nor riſe from the Bed, did approach more near unto them, and was reſolved to draw them off either by the head or heels; But when ſhe found as well by their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit as by their Countenances, that they were not thoſe whom ſhe ſuſpected, and perceived who they were, ſhe trembled down upon her knees before them, and beſought them to pardon the great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence ſhe had committed in diſturbing their Reſt. Monſieur <hi>de Vendoſme</hi> being not contented to know ſo little, did immediatly riſe from the bed, and did requeſt the old Maid to tell him who they were

Having ſpoke thoſe words, ſhe departed, and made faſt the door, and left the Prince and Princeſſe together as ſhe found them, where they continued an hour laughing at the accident that had befallen them; and although that afterwards they related to divers perſonages of Honour this Story, yet they would never name the perſons whom it did concern.</p>

                  <hi>Ladies, you may here obſerve how a good: old Woman thinking to do a piece of Justice, did declare that unto ſtrange Princes, which none of the ſame Houſe wherein ſhe lived did once ſuspect. I do believe, ſaid</hi> Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I can tell in what Houſe it was, and who was the Protonotary, for he hath been of ſome Authority here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore in the Houſe of Ladies, where when he could not obtain the favour of the Miſtreſs, he would not fail to procure the love of ſome one of her Maids, but now he is known to be a man of good parts? and of good Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherefore do you speak, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that he is now known to be a Man of good parts; for in that lay the Act for which he did eſteem himſelf to be a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi> Parlament <hi>made anſwer to him, I do perceive very well that you know both the Diſeaſe, and the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and if there ſhould be need of Excuſes, you would not fail to be his Advocate. Howſoever, for my part, he ſhould never ſail in my Boat, who did ſo ill conduct his own, that even the Chambermaids themſelves muſt take notice of what was done. Do you think, ſaid</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merfide, <hi>that Men after they have arrived to the end of their Deſires, do take care who knows it? You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:119929:267"/>that if there were none who either did or could ſpeak of it, yet they would make it known of themſelves.</hi> Hircan <hi>in choler replyed unto her, It is not requiſit that. Men ſhould speak all that which they know. She bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did make anſwer, You ſay well, for otherwiſe they might ſpeak ſomething which peradventure would tend but little to their Honour. I have often heard you ſpeak, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>that Men take delight to ſpeak Evil of Women, and I am confident that you rank me in that number; Wherefore, believe me, I have a great deſire to speak well of them, that I might not be miſtaken by the whole Sex for a Detractor.

                  <hi>RObernall</hi> making a Voyage on the Sea to the Iſſe of <hi>Canada,</hi> being Governour of that Fleet by the Commandment of the King his Maſter, he reſolved to continue in the ſaid Iland, if the Air of the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:119929:268"/>Country had been healthfull, and to build there Towns and Caſtles. In which he made ſo good a beginning, that to be ſatisfied in the fruitfulneſs of the place, and to inhabite it with Chriſtians, he took with him divers ſorts of Artiſts, amongſt whom there was one ſo wicked, and barbarouſly cruel, that he betrayed his own Maſter, and did bring him in great danger to be taken by the Inhabitants of the Country; But it pleaſed God that his Enterprize was diſcovered, and Captain <hi>Robernall</hi> received no prejudice at all, who commanded the miſcinevous Traytor to be apprehended, reſolving to bring him unto puniſhment, according to his deſerts. You are to underſtand that he had contrived the plot with the Inhabitants againſt the knowledge of his Wife, who having followed her Husband thorough the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils of the Sea, would not abandon him until death; but with her tears, and her petitions, ſhe ſo prevailed with the Captain and all the Company, that in Compaſſion of her, and in regard of the good ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ſhe had done, he did grant her her requeſt, but upon a condition, that both ſhe and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhould be left in a little Iland in the Sea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited only by wild Beaſts, and to take that with them which ſhould be neceſſary for their ſuſtenance, and to defend themſelves. This wretched Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and his poor Wife finding themſelves alone, and in a wilderneſs of ſorrows, having none but cruel wild Beaſts to keep them company, had their recourſe unto God alone, who had been alwayes the hope, and the aſſurance of that deſolate Woman, who, as one who had all her comfort in him, did take along with her, for the Inſtruction and nouriſhment of her Soul, and for all her comfort and her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, the New Teſtament, in which inceſſantly ſhe did read. The Extremity of Winter approaching, ſhe did take pains with her Husband to build a little Houſe, the Lions, and other wild Beaſts approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to devour them, but her Husband with his
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:119929:268"/>Harquebuſe, and ſhe with great ſtones, did ſo well defend themſelves, that not only the Beaſts, nor the Birds durſt adventure to come near them, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes they would kill thoſe which were good to eat, and with ſuch fleſh and herbs that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try did bring forth, they did live a certain time, when their bread failed them. But her Husband could not long endure that nouriſhment, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the abundance of the cold water which he drank, he was ſo blown up with a Dropſie, that in a ſhort time he deceaſed, having none to aſſiſt him, or to comfort him, but his Wife, who was both his Phyſician and his Confeſſor, and having given him the beſt Comforts ſhe could adminiſter, he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with joy from that Deſart unto Paradiſe. And the poor Woman being left alone, did bury him in the ground not far from her houſe as well as poſſibly ſhe could; but the Beaſts had immediately the ſent of him, and ſmelling to the Grave, they did digg with their paws to find out, and feed upon the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs, but the poor woman did ſhoot at them out of her little houſe, and did drive them away with the Harquebuſe, uſing her endeavour that the fleſh of her Husband might not have ſuch a Sepulcher. And thus living with her body the life of a Beaſt, and in her Soul the life of an Angel, ſhe paſſed away her time in reading, contemplation, and in prayers, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a contented, and a joyfull ſpirit in a lean and a conſumed body. But God, who never doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe in their diſtreſs who do put their truſt in him, and who in the greateſt deſpair doth make his mercy and his power to be moſt remarkable, did not permit, that the Virtue with which he had indued that Woman ſhould be concealed from Men, but that it ſhould be manifeſted to his glory. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the end of a certain time, one of the ſhipps belonging to the <hi>French</hi> Fleet paſſing before that Iland, the people who were above the Decks did ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a Woman, waving with her hand her Apron
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:119929:269"/>over her head, and making a ſign unto them, whereupon the Maſter of the ſhip immediatly called to mind thoſe two whom they had left upon that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and determined with himſelf to goe unto them, and to ſee how God had diſpoſed of them.</p>
               <p>The poor Woman ſeeing the ſhip to make up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, and to draw near unto the ſhore, did come down into the Beach, where they took her in, and departed. Having praiſed God for her unexpected preſervation, ſhe ſhewed them where her little houſe did ſtand in the Iland, and did inform them what was her miſerable Diet during the time of her melancholy abode there; which had been altogether incredible to the Seamen, but that they knew that God is as able to nouriſh his People in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as with the beſt Diet in the greateſt Palace of the World. And when on their return they had cauſed the fidelity and the perſeverance of the ſaid Woman to be made known, both in the City, and at the Court, ſhe was received with great Honour by all the Ladies, who of their own accord did ſend their Children to her to teach them to work with the Needle, and to Read, and Write; And by that honeſt indeavour ſhe gained ſufficiently wherewith to live all the remainder of her life, having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire but to exhort every one to the love of God, and to a ſafe conſidence in him, propounding for an example the great Mercy which he had vouchſafed unto her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, you cannot now deny but that I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly extolled thoſe virtues with which God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued you, which are ſo much the greater, as the Subject is the weaker. We are not ſorry (ſaid</hi> Oyſilla) <hi>that you praiſe the Graces of God in us; for to speak the truth, all Virtues doe proceed from him. And in this we muſt make no diſtinction, for we are builded up of the ſame materials, and Woman is of the workmanſhip of God as well as Man. It is neither one nor the other that by their deſires or indeavours can do any more than
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:119929:269"/>plant, It is God only that doth give the increaſe. If you have read the Scripture adviſedly, ſaid</hi> Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredant, <hi>you ſhall find that Saint</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, It is</hi> Paul <hi>that planteth, and</hi> Apollo <hi>that watereth, but you ſhall never read that Women did put their hands to the Work of God. You would follow, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>the opinion and practice of ſome evil Men, who will make uſe of, and wreſt ſome place of the Scripture for themſelves, and will leave out that which doth make againſt them. If you had read the Epistles of Saint</hi> Paul <hi>throughout, you would find that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends himſelf to ſome good Women who had laboured with him in the Work of the Goſpel. Howſoever it be, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that Woman was worthy of great praiſe, as well for the Love which ſhe did bear unto her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for whom ſhe did put her life in jeopardy, as the faith which ſhe had in God, who as we find in the ſtory did not forſake her. As to the firſt I believe, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that there is no Woman preſent here, who would not willingly do as much to ſave the life of her Husband. I do delieve, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>that there are Husbands who are ſuch beaſts, that thoſe Women who live with them cannot think it ſtrange to live with their like.</hi> Emarſuite <hi>ſuppoſing that ſhe was included in that number could not forbear from ſpeaking to her, And if thoſe beaſts do not bite, their company is more pleaſant than the Company of thoſe Men, who are ſo cholerick that they are not to be indured. But I will follow my diſcourſe, and will affirm that if my Husband were in ſuch danger, I would die before I would forſake him. Take heed, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>that you do not love him ſo well, that too much love doth not deceive both your ſelf and him; for there is a moderation to be had in all things, and oftentimes Love being not rightly underſtood doth beget hate. I do believe, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>you had not proceeded ſo far in this diſcourſe, unleſſe you had a a deſire to confirm what you have spoken by ſome Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: And therefore if you have any Account to that purpoſe, I give you my voice to relate it. Well then, ſaid</hi>
                  <pb n="482" facs="tcp:119929:270"/>Nomerfide, <hi>according to my Cuſtom, I will make it both ſhort and merry; for I will not inlarge it unto tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but ſo deliver it unto you, that you ſhall find as much mirth to underſtand it, as I ſhall to repreſent it to you; It is briefly thus.</hi>

               <p>IN the City of <hi>Pau</hi> in <hi>Bearn,</hi> there lived an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary called Maſter <hi>Eſtienne,</hi> who had eſpouſed a virtuous Woman, a good Houſwife, and beautiful enough to give him content. But as he did make taſt of divers Druggs, ſo he did oftentimes of divers Women, to enable himſelf the better to diſcourſe of all Complexions, whereat his Wife was ſo much tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that ſhe loſt all patience; for he made no reckoning of her, but only in <hi>Ember</hi> weeks for pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. One day this Apothecary being in his ſhop, and his Wife cloſe behind the Arras, where ſhe did conceal her ſelf, the better to liſten to what he ſaid, there came unto him one of his Goſſips, a Woman of the City, and troubled with the ſame diſeaſe as was his Wife, and ſighing to the Apothecary, ſhe ſaid unto him, Wo is me my Friend, I am the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate woman in the world: for I do love my Husband as I do love my ſelf, and do think on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to ſerve him and obey him; but all my labour is but loſt, for he loveth the moſt wicked, the moſt deformed, and the moſt naſty Slut in all the City, better than he loveth me, I do therefore pray you my good Neighbour, if you have in your
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:119929:270"/>Shop any Drugg that may ſerve to change his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, that you would let me have it; for I am not well uſed by him; and I aſſure you when I am able, I will give you to the uttermoſt of my power for it.</p>
               <p>The Apothecary having a great deſire to comfort her, did ſay unto her, That he had a powder, which if ſhe did put it into ſomething boyled or roſted, and ſo give it unto her Husband, it would make him to give her the beſt and fulleſt contentment in the world. The poor woman, deſirous to ſee that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, did ask of him, What it was? and if it were of ſo eaſie a price that ſhe was able to purchaſe it? He repreſented to her, that it was of no great value, it was only the powder of <hi>Cantharides,</hi> of which he had great ſtore in his ſhop; and before ſhe did go away, ſhe conſtrained him to prepare, and weigh out ſome of that powder for her, and ſhe took with her ſo much as he knew would ſerve to do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for which ſhe afterwards did pay him, and thanked him many times very heartily for it; for her Husband, who was a ſtrong and an able bodied Man, and did not take too much of it, did not find himſelf the worſe for it, and ſhe did find him the better. The wife of the Apothecary, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all this diſcourſe, did think with her ſelf that ſhe ſtood altogether in as much need of the receipt as her companion. And obſerving the place where her Husband did put the powder that was left, ſhe reſolved that ſhe would make uſe of it her ſelf, when ever ſhe found opportunity, which within three or four dayes afterwards ſhe did, her Husband deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her to make him ſome good pottage, (for he was troubled with a great cold in his Stomach) ſhe told him, that ſomething roſted would doe better, and be more profitable, wherefore he commanded her to go preſently to the Market, and to buy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to roſt, and to take Cinamon and Sugar out of the Shop to put into the Sauce: which ſhe did
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:119929:271"/>accordingly, and did not forget the remainder of the powder which he did give to her Companion, and did put it in without regard either of Ounce, Weight, or meaſure. Her Husband did feed on the roſt meat which ſhe had prepared, and found it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and not long afterwards he found the heat and the effect of it, which he thought to qualifie with his Wife, which was not poſſible for him to do, for the heat within him and the inſtigation was ſo extraordinary, that he did not know on which ſide to turn him. He did bear his Wife down that ſhe had poyſoned him, and was very importunate to know of her what ſhe had put in his Roaſtmeat. She confeſſed the truth unto him, and withall aſſured him, that ſhe had as much need of that Receipt as the Wife of his Companion. The poor Apothecary could not beat her for the wrong ſhe had done him, he was at that time in ſo great an extremity, but commanded her to goe out of his ſight, and ſent for the Apothecary of the Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him that he would take the pains to give him a viſit, who gave him all the cooling Receits that were effectual for his recovery.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time he was well mended, and the Queens Apothecary did reprehend him very ſharply for his raſhneſſe, that he was ſo unwiſe to counſel another to take thoſe druggs which he would not uſe himſelf, and that the good Woman his Wife had done no more than what ſhe ought to doe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſeeing the great deſire which ſhe had to make him love her. Whereupon the poor Man was inforced to overcome his folly with patience, and to acknowledge that God juſtly puniſhed him, to make that mockery fall upon himſelf which he had prepared for another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, in my Judgement the Love of this Wife was as indiſcreet as it was great. Do you call that, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>Love to her Husband, to make him ſuffer torment, in a fond hope that ſhe might receive ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

I do believe, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>that ſhe had no other intention than to recover her Husbands love, which ſhe conceived, if not to be altogether loſt, yet certainly to be gone aſtray; for to obtain ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity there is nothing which Women will refuſe to do. So it is, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>that whatſoever the occaſion be, a Woman ought not to give any thing unto her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band either to eat or to drink, which ſhe knows not as well by her own experience, as friends of good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether it be hurtful or no; But Ignorance ought to be excuſed, and this Woman is excuſable both for the paſſion which of all is moſt blinding, that is Love, and for the perſon moſt blinded, which is a Woman, who hath ſeldome judgement enough to mannage with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any great Act.</hi> Guebron, <hi>ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>you do not now follow your commendable cuſtom, which is to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſelf agreeable to your Companions, for I am confident there are Women who have patiently endured both love and jealouſie, which is an Act difficult enough. Yes, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>and pleaſantly too, for thoſe Women who are moſt wiſe do take as much pleaſure to laugh at the follies of their Husbands, as their Husbands take pleaſure ſecretly to deceive them. And if you will give me the place before that Madam</hi> Oyſilla <hi>ſhall put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to this days Account, I will relate a ſtory to you, and done ſo lately, that there is not one here preſent, who doth not know both the Husband and the Wife.

               <head>An Italian ſuffered himſelf to be cajoled by his Chambermaid, who cauſed, that inſtead of her Servant, her Miſtreſſe ſhould take her Husband bolting.</head>
               <head type="sub">The ninth Novel.</head>
               <p>IN the Caſtle of <hi>Doz</hi> in <hi>Bigorre</hi> there dwelled a Servant of the Kings, who was called <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> who had eſpouſed a virtuous woman, and of a good Eſtate, who having brought him many Children, did grow old, and he was none of the youngeſt himſelf, and lived with her in great peace and love. It is true enough, that ſometimes he would talk familiarly unto his Chambermaids, at which the good woman would not put on the leaſt apparence of diſcontent, but gave them all the ſcope they could deſire, when ſhe knew them to be moſt privat together in the houſe. One day ſhe hired a Servant, who was a wiſe and a handſom Girl, to whom ſhe related the complexion and diſpoſition of her Husband, and her own; and aſſured her, that if ſhee were a Slut her Husband would never endure her, but turn her out of doors immediatly. The Chambermaid, therefore, to continue in a good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the ſervice of her Miſtreſſe, did reſolve with her ſelf to follow her buſineſſe roundly, and to be neat and carefull, and to give no ear to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of her Maſter, who, though oftentimes he did hold her in Diſcourſe, and inticed her unto wantonneſſe, yet ſhe would make no reckoning of him, but would acquaint her Miſtreſſe with all his flatteries and promiſes. As they paſſed away their time in the Legend of his follies, one day this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid bolted in the back Chamber, having on her head a long hood, after the faſhion of that Country, which is made like a Kerchief, but only that this covereth the ſhoulders, and all the body behind. Her Maſter ſeeing her in this habit, did come unto
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:119929:272"/>her, and ſollicited her with much importunity; but ſhe, who would rather die than give conſent unto him, did make an apparence to yield to his deſires, and demanded leave to go firſt forth, and ſee if her Miſtreſſe were buſie about any thing, to the end that they might not be both ſurprized, which her Maſter did agree unto, and ſhe beſought him in her abſence to put her Hood on his head, and to bolt, that her Miſtreſs might alwayes hear the noiſe of the Bolter. This joyfully he performed, hoping to enjoy that which he demanded. The Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, who was not of a melancholike humour, did run unto her Miſtreſſe, and ſaid unto her, Come and ſee your good Husband, whom I have taught to bolt, to acquit my ſelf of him. His Wife made all the haſt ſhe could to behold this new Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, and ſeeing the long Hood on her Husbands head, and the Bolter in his hands, ſhe did begin to laugh ſo heartily, and ſo to clap her hands, that ſhe had much to do to ſpeak unto him, In good time Honeſt Maid! What wages ſhall I give you a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for your good ſervice? The Husband hearing the voice of his Wife, and finding he was betrayed, did throw on the ground that which he carried on his head, and what he held in his hands, to run after the Chambermaid, calling her Whore a thouſand times. And if his Wife had not interpoſed her ſelf, and skreened betwixt his paſſion, and the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids honeſt mirth, he had payed her with his cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; But ſhe appeaſed him to the content of every one, and after that time they lived together without the leaſt complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, What think you of this good woman? Did ſhe not do wiſely to paſs away her time in mirth, at the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes of her Husband? It was no paſtime to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>to have failed in his Enterprize. I do believe, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that he took more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to laugh afterwards with his Wife, than being three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years of age to play the wanton with his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid.
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:119929:273"/>It would have been no little perplexity to me, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>to be taken by my Wife with ſuch a Kerchief on my head. I have heard it ſpoken, ſaid</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament, <hi>that many years are not paſſed, ſince your Wife was very like to have taken you in almoſt ſuch another habiliment, how ſtrange ſoever you do ſeem to make of it, and that ſhe hath lived a diſcontented life ever ſince. Content your ſelf with the fortunes of your own houſe, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>without taking thankleſſe pains in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king after mine. Howſoever, I dare aſſure you, that my Wife hath no cauſe at all to complain of me; and although I were ſuch as you report me to be, yet ſhe could never have the means to perceive it, by reaſon of the numerous urgency of ſo many buſineſſes, which do take up all her imployment. Women of Honour, ſuch as ſhe is, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>do need no other buſineſs, nor deſire any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but only the love of their Husbands, which only can content them; but they who ſeek after a Beſtial contentment, will never find it where Honeſty doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them. Do you, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>call it Beſtial contentment, for a woman to deſire that of her Husband which doth belong unto her?</hi> Longaren <hi>made anſwer to him, I will maintain, that a chaſt woman, having her heart filled with true Love, is more ſatisfied by being intirely beloved, than with all the pleaſures that the body can deſire. I am of your opinion, ſaid</hi> Dagou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin, <hi>though the Gallants that be here preſent, will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtand it, nor confeſſe it; for I do verily believe, that if a reciprocal love doth not content a woman, one Musband will never content her; for, not living accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the honeſt love of women, ſhe muſt be poſſeſſed with the inſatiable deſires of a Beaſt. Truly, ſaid</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla, <hi>you do put me in mind of a great Lady, and moſt honourably married, who not living in that honeſt love, became more ſenſual than Swine, and more outragious than Lions. I muſt intreat you, Madam,</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Saffre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant) <hi>to put an end to the Accounts of this Day, that you will relate unto us the the Story of it. I cannot do it, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>for two reaſons, the firſt, by reaſon of
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:119929:273"/>the great length of it, and the other becauſe it is not of our time, although it hath been recited by a very credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author; And we have ſworn to one another to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert nothing into theſe Novels which hath been written by others. It is true, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>and I do believe that I have read it; but becauſe it hath been written in old</hi> French, <hi>and ſo long agoe that I am almoſt confident that neither Man nor Woman here preſent, beſides us two have ever ſeen it or heard it ſpoken of, it may well paſſe for a Novelty. On that aſſurance all the Company did intreat her to relate it, without any reſpect to the length thereof, becauſe they might yet continue where they were a full hour before that Vespers did begin.</hi> Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilla <hi>therefore at their request did thus begin.</hi>

               <head>The Excellent Hiſtory of the outragious incontinence of a Dutcheſſe, which was the occaſion of her death, as alſo of the Deaths of two perfect Lovers.</head>
               <head type="sub">The tenth Novel.</head>
               <p>IN the Dutchy of <hi>Burgundy</hi> there lived a Duke who was a moſt courteous and a moſt gallant Prince, and was eſpouſed to a Lady whole beauty ſo highly did content him, that he ſeemed almoſt to forget the greatneſſe of his condition, out of a tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to pleaſe her only, which affection, to outward appearance, ſhe did reciprocally return.</p>
               <p>There was in the Dukes Palace a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, accompliſhed with all the perfections that could be deſired in a Man. He was generally belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all, but eſpecially by the Duke, who had brought him up from his Infancy to attend upon him next unto his Perſon, and ſeeing him ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned, he did love him moſt intirely, and gave him the charge of all thoſe affairs which his
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:119929:274"/>age was of a capacity to manage.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſſe, who had not the heart of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor of a virtuous Princeſſe, did not content her ſelf with the love which the Duke her Husband did bear unto her, nor with the good uſe which ſhe received from him, but oftentimes with too friendly an eye did look upon this Gentleman, whom ſhe found ſo agreeable unto her fancy, that ſhe loved him beyond all reaſon, and a great trouble it was unto her, to diſcover her affection to him, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very minute ſhe endeavoured to do; but for all the temptation of her ſmiles, for all her ſighes, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate regards, he did not ſeem to underſtand her: for the young Gentleman, who altogether ſtudyed Virtue, in whoſe School he was brought up, did not apprehend the vice of that Lady, which ſhe had ſo ſmall an occaſion to put in practiſe: inſomuch that the glances, and allurements of this fooliſh Lady, did bring unto her no other fruit, but a furious Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. And this Deſpair did one day ſo overcome her, that forgetting her Sex, and that ſhe was a Woman who ought to be intreated, and to refuſe the Intreaty, a Princeſſe that ought to be adored, and to diſdain her Idolaters, ſhe aſſumed the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a tranſported Woman, to diſcharge that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which was inſupportable: For her Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone to his Council, who were aſſembled for the management of the great affairs of State, at which this Gentleman, by reaſon of the inexperience of his Youth, was not permitted to aſſiſt, ſhe made a ſign unto him that he ſhould come unto her, which he did, thinking ſhe had ſome buſineſſe wherein to imploy his ſervice; but ſhe leaning on his Arm, as a Lady weary of too much eaſe, did take him aſide by himſelf to walk with her alone in the Gallery, where ſhe ſaid unto him, I do much wonder at you, that being ſo young, ſo lovely, and full of all Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and withall being brought up, and living in my Court, where are ſo fair a number of young Ladies,
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:119929:274"/>that yet you have never been in love, nor a ſervant to any of them. And looking on him with the moſt gracious eye that poſſibly ſhe could, ſhe held her peace, to give him leave to anſwer. Madam (ſaid he) If I were worthy that your Highneſſe could vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to deſcend ſo low as to look on me, it would be no occaſion of wonder in you, to obſerve a man ſo unworthy as my ſelf, to preſent his ſervice to a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and to receive nothing but the diſgrace of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe. The Dutcheſſe hearing his wiſe reply, did love him better than before, and did ſwear unto him, that there was not a Lady in her Court that ſhould not think her ſelf too much honoured in ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and aſſured him that he might well make a tryal of it, for without all queſtion it would fall out unto his honour.</p>
               <p>The young Gentleman all this while did hold his eyes down towards the Ground, not daring to behold her looks, which carried with them heat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the Ice to melt. As he was about to excuſe himſelf, the Duke ſent for the Dutcheſſe to the Council Table, about ſome buſineſſe which did concern her, whither ſhe did go in obedience to his Commands; but ſhe was very ſorry that ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to loſe the opportunity to follow the Cauſe which ſhe had ſo well begun to lay open. But the Gentleman ſeemed not to underſtand one word what ſhe had ſaid unto him; whereat ſhe was ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and troubled, that ſhe knew not to what to impute the cauſe of her affliction, but only to the ſottiſh fear with which ſhe found the Gentleman to be too much abuſed; Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, obſerving with her ſelf that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ſo dull that he would not underſtand her language, ſhe reſolved to regard neither fear not ſhame, but plainly to declare her mind unto him, aſſuring her ſelf, That a beauty ſo powerfull as her own, could not but be well entertained, but ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired rather to have had the honour to be entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:119929:275"/>by him; nevertheleſſe, ſo violent was her love, that ſhe laid her Honour aſide to ſatisfie her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And having tempted him diverſe ways to work him up to her own height, and to find his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires anſwerable to her own, finding no anſwer from him that promiſed the leaſt hope, ſhe took him one day by the ſteeve: and ſaid unto him, that ſhe had a buſineſſe or great privacy and importance to declare unto him. The Gentleman, with ſuch reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and humility as was due unto her, did goe along with her into a deep by Window, to which place ſhe had called him; And looking about her, when ſhe found that none of her Chamber could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry her, ſhe began with a trembling voice betwixt Deſire and Fear to continue unto him the ſubject of her firſt diſcourſe, reproving him that he had not yet made choice of any Lady in her Court, aſſuring him, that whatſoever ſhe was, and in whatſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſhe would aſſiſt him in the obtaining of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman being as much amazed as tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the importunities of the Dutcheſſe, did make anſwer to her, Madam, I have ſo ſtour a heart, that if I were once refuſed of any, I ſhould never again enjoy my ſelf in this World, and I am ſo inconſiderable a thing, that there is not a Lady in your Court but ſcorns to accept of my ſervice. The Dutcheſſe bluſhing, and thinking that ſhe had preſſed him ſo much upon it, that he was half over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, did ſwear unto him, that if he thought well of it, ſhe knew that the greateſt Lady of the Court, none excepted, would entertain him with great joy, and that he ſhould receive an abſolute contentment by it. Alas Madam (ſaid he) It cannot be, that any Lady in your Court ſhould be ſo unfortunately blinded as to accept me to be her Servant. The Dutcheſſe perceiving that he would not apprehend her, did begin in ſome manner to diſcover her paſſion to him, and by reaſon of the fear ſhe had
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:119929:275"/>of the virtue of the Gentleman, ſhe did ſpeak unto him by the way of interrogation, and ſaid. If For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had ſo much favoured you, that it was I my ſelf that do bear this great good will unto you, what will you ſay? The Gentleman who thought he dreamed; and that ſuch a word could not proceed from the Dutcheſſe, did ſpeak unto her with his knees upon the Ground, Madam, ſince God hath given me the grace to have had your favour, and the favour of the Duke my Maſter, I doe conceive my ſelf to be the moſt happy man in the World, for it was the recompenſe which I deſired for my faithful ſervice, as being obliged more than any other to loſe my life for the ſervice of either of you, being confident Madam, that the love which you do bear to my Lord the Duke is accompanied with ſuch a Chaſtity and greatneſſe, that not only my ſelf, who am but a Worm of the Earth, but the greateſt Prince, and the moſt excellent man that can be found in the World, can never infringe the Union betwixt the Duke my Maſter, and your ſelf: And for my ſelf he hath brought me up from my Infancy, and made me to be ſuch as I am; Wherefore he hath neither Wife, nor Daughter, nor Siſter, nor Mother, for whom I would not rather die than nouriſh a thought which ſhall misbecome a loyal and a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant. The Dutcheſſe would not permit him to paſſe any further, but finding that ſhe was in danger to receive from him a diſhonourable denyal, ſhe did ſuddenly break off this diſcourſe, and ſaid unto him. O obſtinate and glorious Fool! who is ſhe who doth intreat thee? You think by reaſon of your beauty to be beloved by flies in the Air, but if you had been ſo preſumptuous to have addreſſed your ſelf to me, I ſhould have made it apparent to you, that I neither doe, nor can love you, nor will love any other but my Husband. And the diſcourſe which often times I have had with you hath ſerved me only to paſſe away my time, and to dive into
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:119929:276"/>your thoughts to make my ſelf merry with them, as I uſe to do with fooliſh Lovers.</p>
               <p>Madam (ſaid the Gentleman) I both did, and do believe the words you ſpeak. She without hearing any word more, did immediately repair into her Chamber, and obſerving that ſhe was attended with many Ladies, ſhe entred into her Cabinet, and made ſo great a lamentation, that it cannot well be repreſented; for, on the one ſide the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in her love did bring upon her a mortal Grief; and on the other, the Indignation and Deſpite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her ſelf to have motioned ſo fond an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe to him, who ſo wiſely anſwered her Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, did put her into ſuch a fury, that ſometimes ſhe was reſolved to commit a murder upon her ſelf, ſometimes again ſhe would live to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on him, whom ſhe held to be her moſt mortal Enemy.</p>
               <p>After ſhe had a long time wept by her ſelf, ſhe counterfeited her ſelf to be ſick, becauſe ſhe would not be at Supper with the Duke, at which the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did ordinarily ſerve. The Duke, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Wife better than he loved himſelf, did go to viſit her: But ſhe, the better to arrive unto the end at which ſhe aimed, did ſay unto him, that ſhe was great with Child, which cauſed a rheum to fall upon her eyes, and did put her to great pain. In this manner there paſſed three or four dayes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Dutcheſſe kept her bed, ſo ſad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, that the Duke conceived that ſomething elſe beſides her great Belly, was the occaſion of her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which cauſed him the fourth night to come to bed unto her, that he might better be informed of the nature of her Diſeaſe; wherefore making as much of her as poſſibly he could, and perceiving that ſhe continually did ſigh, he ſaid unto her, Sweet-heart, You know that I do bear ſo much love unto you, as I do to the preſervation of my own life, and that if your life ſhould fail, mine
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:119929:276"/>could not long continue; Wherefore, if you will improve my health and recover your own, tell me, I pray you, what is the Cauſe which doth make you ſo much to ſigh almoſt without intermiſſion; for I believe that ſuch a Malady cannot proceed only from your great Belly.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſſe perceiving her Husband to be ſo kind unto her, as that ſhe could not have deſired him to be more, thinking that now was the time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her ſelf on the denying Gentleman, ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Duke, and beginning to weep abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe ſaid unto him, Alas! my Lord, The greateſt grief which I have is, to ſee you deceived by thoſe, who are ſo much obliged to maintain your Honour, and your welfare. The Duke underſtanding thoſe word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, had a great deſire to know by whom it was ſhe ſpoke them, and with much importunity did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her without fear to declare unto him all the Truth. She having made many denyals, the better to colour her pretence, did at the laſt ſay unto him, I do not wonder much if Strangers make Warr on Princes, when thoſe who are moſt obliged to them do enterpriſe ſo wicked a Deed, that the loſſe of Goods is nothing in compariſon of it. Sir, I will tell you the Gentleman, (and ſpeaking thoſe words, ſhe gave him the name of him whom ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;) He (ſaid ſhe) being nouriſhed by your own hand, advanced, and treated more like a kinſman, or a Son, than a Servant, hath dared to undertake ſo cruel, and ſo wretched an enterpriſe, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the loſſe of the honour of your Wife, in which conſiſts the honour of your Houſe, and of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And although, for a long time, he hath made many covert Invitations of Allurement, tending to the Accompliſhment of his wicked Deſign, yet my heart, which hath regarded none but your ſelf, would underſtand nothing at all, untill that at the laſt he declared himſelf by his words. To which I returned ſuch an anſwer, as my heart and my chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:119929:277"/>did command me; Nevertheleſſe, I have ever ſince born ſuch a hatred to him, that I cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to look on him, which is the cauſe that I have kept my Chamber, and loſt the happineſſe of your Company, beſeeching you that you will no longer keep any ſuch Servant near unto your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For after ſo great a crime, he fearing that I may acquaint you with it, may yet commit a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sir, I have here given you the cauſe of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, which ſeems to me to be ſo juſt, that it is worthy you ſhould give a ſudden redreſſe unto it.</p>
               <p>The Duke, who loved his Wife, and (according to her accuſation) did find her to be much injured, and himſelf alſo to be intereſted in it, and on the other ſide loved his Servant, of whoſe fidelity he had ſo great experience, that he could hardly believe this Fable to be a truth, was in a great perplexity, and being filled with choler and amazement, did command his Servant not to appear in his preſence, but for a certain time to withdraw himſelf from the Court. The Gentleman, being altogether ignorant of the occaſion, was as much grieved as poſſibly could be, being conſcious to himſelf that his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe and fidelity did deſerve a far better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And being well aſſured of his loyalty, and demeanour, he ſent one of his Companions to ſpeak unto the Duke, and to preſent his Letter to him, moſt humbly beſeeching him, that if by any falſe inſtigation he was removed from his preſence, he would be pleaſed to ſuſpend his Judgement, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he had been examined, and the truth of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation had been underſtood, and that he would then find that he had not given him the leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of offence.</p>
               <p>The Duke, reading the Letter, did a little rebate the edge of his fury, and privately ſent for him to come into his Chamber to him; the Gentleman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, he look'd upon him with a furious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſaid. I never thought that the care I
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:119929:277"/>taken to bring you up from your infancy as my own Child, ſhould be turned into a repentance to have ſo highly advanced you, Since you have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to bring that upon me, which would be more prejudicial to me than the loſſe of my life, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, in ſeeking by corrupting the Honour of her, who is half of my ſelf, to render my Houſe, and my poſterlty infamous throughout all ages; You may well conceive that ſuch an injury doth leave ſuch an impreſſion in my heart, that if it were not for the doubt I entertain, whether the report be true or no, you had been before this in the bottom of the Sea, and had in ſecret received a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for that offence which ſecretly you would have committed againſt me. The Gentleman was not much amazed at his words, for his innocence did cauſe him to ſpeak with confidence unto him; and did beſeech him that he would be pleaſed to tell him who was his Accuſer, for ſuch words (ſaid he) ought rather to be juſtified by the Lance, than by the tongue. Your Accuſer (ſaid the Duke) doth bear no other Arms but her own Chaſtity, for I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that no other Woman but my own Wife did diſcloſe it to me, and withal hath beſought me to take vengeance on you. The poor Gentleman obſerving the great malice of the Lady, would not altogether accuſe her, but ſaid unto him, Sir, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam the Dutcheſſe may ſay what ſhe pleaſeth, and what already ſhe hath ſpoken, you doe know far better than my ſelf, but believe me Sir, I did never ſee her out of your company but once, or twice, at the moſt, at which time ſhe did not expreſſe her ſelf in many words unto me. God hath indued you with as much Judgement, as any Prince that I doe know in Chriſtendom, wherefore, Sir, I beſeech you to tell me, if you did ever obſerve in me the leaſt Countenance which might beget the leaſt ſuſpition, for Love is a Fire which cannot ſo long he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but it will be ſometimes diſcovered by thoſe
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:119929:278"/>who languiſh in the ſame malady. I beſeech you Sir, that you would believe two things in me, the one is, that I am ſo loyal to you, that if your Wife were the moſt beautiful, and the moſt accompliſhed Lady in the World, yet Love ſhould never ſo much overcome me, as to ſtain my honour and my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; the other is, that if ſhe were not your Wife, yet of all the Women which I have ſeen, ſhe is that Lady of whom I ſhould be the leaſt amorous, and there are beſides her in your Court many other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies on whom more readily I could fix my fancy.</p>
               <p>The Duke began to ſoften himſelf into a mercy having heard theſe words of truth, &amp; ſaid unto him, I do believe what you have repreſented to me, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continue your place in your attendance on me, as you have been accuſtomed; for I aſſure you that if I ſhall find the truth to be on your ſide, I ſhall love you yet better than ever I have done; and if I ſhall find to the contrary, Know that your life doth ly in my hands. The Gentleman did humbly thank him, and did ſubmit himſelf to all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if he were found guilty. The Dutcheſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Gentleman to continue ſtill in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Duke, as he was accuſtomed to do, could not endure it with patience, but ſaid unto her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, It would be no great matter (Sir) if you were poyſoned; becauſe you have more confidence in your mortal Enemies, than in your friends. He replyed, Sweet-heart, Torment not your ſelf concerning that affair; for if I can find that to be true which you have ſpoken, I do aſſure you that he ſhall not be alive four and twenty hours: but he hath ſworn ſo much unto me to the contrary, (and I my ſelf beſides could never perceive any thing by him) that, without great proof, I cannot believe any thing unto the contrary. In good truth (Sir) ſaid ſhe, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of your Nature doth render his Iniquity the greater. Would you have a greater proof, than to ſee a Man of his Condition to profeſſe love, and to
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:119929:278"/>make no noiſe thereof: You may believe Sir, that amongſt ſo many Ladies in my Court, ſo young a Fellow as he is would have found out a Miſtreſſe for himſelf, were it not for the high Enterprize, that doth altogether take up his fancy, to be a ſervant unto me; for there was never any young Man that lived in ſuch a Court as yours, ſo ſolitary as this young Man: neither would he be ſo, if he had not his heart fixed in ſo high a place, that he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf only with ſome vain hope; and becauſe you do entertain a belief, that he doth conceal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from you, I muſt beſeech you to put him to his Oath, to know if he be in love with any one, or no. For if he be in love with any other, I am content that you doe believe him, if not, you may aſſure your ſelf that I do ſpeak the Truth.</p>
               <p>The Duke did much approve the reaſons of his Lady, and walking into the fields did take the Gentleman along with him, to whom he ſaid, My Wife doth ſtill continue in her opinion, and doth allege unto me ſuch reaſon for it, that it doth cauſe in me a great ſuſpition againſt you; which is, ſhe wonders much that you being ſo young, and affable, were never yet in love, as much as can be known, which makes me to conceive that you nouriſh that ambitious love of which ſhe doth accuſe you, the hope whereof doth render you ſo contented, and doth fill you with ſo vain a joy, that you cannot think of any other woman; wherfore I do intreat you, as a Friend, and command you, as your Maſter, to tell me plainly, if you are, or ever have been, in love, or no. The poor Gentleman, although he would have delayed to give an anſwer to this unexpected Interrogatory, and would have excuſed his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which, that no other might find it out, he had laid up in the very center of his heart, was now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, to ſatisfie the great Jealouſie of the Duke his Maſter, to ſwear unto him, That it is true enough that he was in love with a Lady, whoſe perfection
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:119929:279"/>was ſuch, that the beauty of the Dutcheſſe, and of all the Ladies in her Court, was but foulneſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity unto her; but he did beſeech him, that he may not be inforced to give unto him her Name, for the obligation betwixt him and his Sweet-heart was ſuch, that who firſt of them did declare their love, ſhould abſolutely diſſolve it. The Duke did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he would preſſe him no more unto it, and was as much contented with the ſatisfaction which he had given him, that he did countenance, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance him more than before, which the Dutcheſſe did very well obſerve, and finding there was more than an accuſtomed privacy betwixt the Duke her Husband, and the Gentleman, ſhe did uſe her utmoſt indeavour to underſtand the occaſion of it, which the Duke could not be perſwaded to reveal unto her, whereupon her fruitful vengeance did beget another jealouſie, and ſhe beſought the Duke to command the Gentleman to impart unto him the name of that Sweet-heart of his, aſſuring him that it was a meer invention, and the beſt way he could contrive to gain credit to his words, but if he would not name who it was whom he eſteemed to be ſo beautiful, he was the moſt fooliſh Prince in the World if he did believe what he profeſſed.</p>
               <p>The poor Duke, whoſe opinion his Wife turned, now on this ſide, and now on that, as ſhe her ſelf pleaſed, did take the poor Gentleman to walk the other turn with him in the Fields again, where he told him that he was in a far greater perplexity than before, for he much doubted that he made him but an excuſe to keep him off from finding out the truth, which did torment him more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Therefore like a Prince he mingled his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities with his intreaties, and did deſire &amp; command him to declare unto him, who it was whom ſo much he loved. The poor Gentleman did beſeech him that he would be mindful of his promiſe, and not inforce him to commit ſo great fault againſt her whom ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:119929:279"/>he affected, as now to break his promiſe which for a long time he had ſo faithfully obſerved, and to loſe in one minute that ſecrecy, which for ſeven years and more he had kept locked up in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſafety, affirming that he had rather ſuffer death, than do ſuch a wrong to her who was ſo faithful unto him. The Duke perceiving he would not acquaint him who it was, did enter into ſo ſtrong a jealouſie, that with a furious countenance he did ſay unto him, Take your choice of two things, either plainly to tell me who it is whom you doe love above all the World, or to depart preſently into baniſhment out of the lands of my Authority, upon this penalty, that if I find you here eight days after this, I will undoubtedly put you to ſome cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el death. If ever grief did poſſeſſe the heart of a loyal Servant, it now did ſeize upon the heart of this Gentleman, who might well ſay <hi>Anguſtiae ſunt mihi Vndi<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan>
                  </hi> for finding on the one ſide that if he ſhould ſpeak the truth, he ſhould loſe his Miſtreſſe, if it ſhould come unto her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, becauſe he had failed in his promiſe, and on the other ſide, if he ſhould not confeſſe it, he ſhould be baniſhed from the Country in which he was brought up, and where his Miſtreſſe lived, and never ſhould have the means to ſee her again, he was ſo oppreſſed with ſorrow, that a cold ſweat did ſeize upon him, as it doth on one who overcome by the extremity of grief, doth find the laſt minute of his life approaching. The Duke looking upon him, and perceiving how much his countenance did change, did Judge (whatſoever he pretended to the contrary) that he had no other Miſtreſſe but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Wife, which was the reaſon (becauſe on the ſudden he could not think on the name of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) he did endure that paſſion. Wherefore he did ſpeak very churliſhly unto him. If that which you have repreſented to me were true, you would not find ſuch a difficulty in it as to declare
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:119929:280"/>unto me her name, but I believe the guilt of your offence doth ſecretly torment you. The Gentleman being much provoked with theſe words, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced alſo by the love which he did bear unto the Duke, did determin with himſelf to ſpeak the truth, being conſident that his Maſter was a Man ſo full of Virtue, that he would not for any thing reveal the ſecret: Wherefore kneeling down before him with hands joyned, which he did lift up unto him, he ſaid; Sir, The obligation which I do bear unto you is ſuch, that it doth prevail upon me more than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fear of Death, for I doe ſee you deluded by ſuch a fancy and falſe opinion of me, that I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to confeſſe that, which no torment could draw from me, beſeeching you for the honour of God, to ſwear unto me upon the faith of a Prince, and of a Chriſtian, that you will never reveal the ſecret, which (ſince you are ſo pleaſed) I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſpeak unto you.</p>
               <p>The Duke immediately by all the Oathes that he could deviſe, did oblige himſelf unto him, that he would never diſcover the leaſt notion thereof to any Creature in the world, neither by word, deed, nor countenance. The Gentleman holding himſelf aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured on the multiplyed Oathes of ſo virtuous a Prince, did begin to lay the foundation of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to come, in confeſſing to him, Sir, It is now ſeven years, ſince having known your Niece to be a Widdow, I have endeavoured to obtain her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; And becauſe I was not of a birth great enough to eſpouſe her, I was contented that ſhe was pleaſed to acknowledge me for her Servant; And God hath hitherto permitted, that our Love hath been ſo wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed, that neither Man or Woman, but only She, and my ſelf, hath known any thing of it, unleſſe it be You, into whoſe hands I do commit my Life, and Honour, beſeeching you that you would keep it private, and to have Madam your Niece in no leſſe eſteem than heretofore: for I do believe, that under
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:119929:280"/>Heaven there is not a more accompliſhed, or a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Creature. Who was a glad Man now? It was the Duke; for knowing the incomparable Beauty of his Niece, he did not doubt, but that ſhe was more agreeable to him than his Wife; but being not able to collect how ſo great a Myſtery could be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed without a Second, he did intreat him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, how he could come to the ſight of her. The Gentleman thereupon did declare unto him, That the Chamber of his Niece did butt forth into the Garden, and on that night when he was to wait upon her, the little door of the Garden was left o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, through which he came, and walked on foot, until he heard a little Dogg bark, which the young Lady his Niece had left on purpoſe in the Garden when all her Women were gone out of it, and that on the barking of that Dogg, being preſently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he had the happineſſe to diſcourſe with her all that night, and at parting they would agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the night when he was to return again, wherein, without making any dilatory excuſes, they would never fail to meet.</p>
               <p>The Duke, who was the moſt curious Man in the World, and who in his Youth knew wiſely enough how to carry his Loves, as well to ſatisfie his ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to underſtand the particulars of ſo ſtrange a ſtory, did intreat him to take him along with him the next time that he did addreſſe himſelf unto her, and to give him then not the reſpects of a Maſter, but of a Companion. The Gentleman, ſeeing the Duke did ſo preſſe him, did accord unto it, of which the Duke was more glad, than if he had gained a Kingdom; and diſſembling that he would he for a hight or two in his Wardrobe, did cauſe two horſes to be made ready, the one for himſelf, and the other for the Gentleman, and they travelled far that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to arrive at his Nieces houſe. The Gentleman cauſed the Duke to enter into the Garden at the little Door, and deſired him, that entring into the
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:119929:281"/>houſe, he would be pleaſed to ſtay behind the skreen, where he might perceive if he had ſpoke the truth unto him, or nor.</p>
               <p>They were no ſooner entred into the Garden, but immediatly a little Dogg did bark, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did go directly towards the houſe, and the young Lady did not fail to meet him in the way; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaluted, and unbraced him, ſhe ſaid unto him, That ſhe was afraid he had been ſick, it was ſo long ſince ſhe laſt ſaw him; and ſpeaking thoſe words, they entred into the Houſe, and the Duke privatly did follow them in the dark, for there was no light in the Room, and underſtanding the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of their chaſt love, he was ſatisfied beyond his deſires, and made no long ſtay there; for the Gentleman told the Lady, that he was conſtrained to return ſooner than he was accuſtomed to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that morning the Duke did intend very early to go on hunting, and of neceſſity he muſt attend upon him.</p>
               <p>The Lady, who loved honour more than pleaſure, would not ſtay him, for the greateſt thing which ſhe eſteemed in her chaſt and honeſt love, was that it was kept ſecret from the obſervation of the World. Much about one of the clock in the morning the Gentleman departed, and the Duke undiſcovered by the young Lady did goe out before him, and they took horſe, and returned from whence they came, and oftentimes in the way the Duke did ſwear unto the Gentleman, that he had rather die a thouſand times, than reveal the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of his Love, and he afterwards did ſo much reſpect him, and did put ſuch a confidence in him, that there was none in all the Court that was in greater favour. The Dutcheſſe was much incenſed at it, and continued her complaints againſt the Gentleman. But the Duke did forbid her to ſpeak any more unto him concerning that Subject, for he was throughly ſatisfied with the truth thereof, and
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:119929:281"/>ſaid, that he was ſo contented thereat, that he did believe the Lady whom he loved was more amiable than her ſelf. That word did leave ſuch an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and did ſo deeply wound her heart, that ſhe fell into a malady greater than before, The Duke did dayly reſort unto her to viſit her, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, but it was impoſſible, unleſſe he would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe unto her who that Lady was who was ſo much beloved; And ſhe ſo much importuned him to know who it was, that the Duke going out of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber did ſay unto her, if you will not let me be at quiet, I muſt depart from you. Thoſe words did increaſe the malady of the Dutcheſſe, who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ſhe did feel her child to ſtir within her, at which the Duke was ſo glad, that to manifeſt his love and joy he did goe to bed to her.</p>
               <p>And making uſe of that minute in which ſhe found him moſt amorous of her, ſhe turned from him to the other ſide, and ſaid unto him, Sir, ſince you bear no love to me, nor to the Infant with which I goe, let us periſh both together. And with thoſe words ſhe poured forth ſuch an abundance of toars, and made ſuch a lamentation, that the Duke was much afraid that ſhe would loſe the fruit of her Womb. Wherefore taking her in his Arms he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her to acquaint him with what ſhe did deſire, and aſſured her that he would conceal nothing from her. Ah Sir, ſaid ſhe, and ſobbed as ſhe ſpake, what hope have I that you will doe any thing for me that is difficult, when you deny me the moſt eaſie, and the moſt reaſonable requeſt in the World, which is to tell me who is the Sweet-heart of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Servant you ever had? I did once believe that you and I had but one heart: But now I find that you doe uſe me as a ſtranger; for thoſe ſecrets which ought to be revealed unto me, are by you concealed and kept from me, as if I were your grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Enemy. Call Sir to mind, how many ſecrets, and buſineſſes of the greateſt importances have you
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:119929:282"/>imparted to me, and which of them have you ever underſtood that I have diſcloſed. You have made ſo great an experience of my good will equal unto yours, that you ought not miſtruſt me, for I am more yours than my own; And if peradventure you have taken an Oath that you will not reveal the ſecret of the Gentleman to any, in acquainting me with it you cannot break your Oath; for I neither am, nor can be any other than your ſelf. I have you in my heart, I do hold you in my arms, I carry your Infant in my womb, in whom you live again, and yet I cannot enjoy your love, as you have mine; but the more loyal and faithful I am to you, the more cruel and perverſe you are to me, that a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times a day I do deſire by a ſudden Death, to deliver your Infant from ſuch a Father, and my ſelf from ſuch a Husband, which I hope ſhortly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; becauſe I do find that you prefer an unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant before your Wife, and ſuch a Wife as I am to you, and before the life of a Mother, and to the fruit of her womb, which is ſo little regarded by you, being not able to obtain that of you which I deſire to know. Speaking thoſe words, ſhe imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and kiſſed her Husband, wetting his face with her tears, and breathed forth ſuch ſighes, that the poor Prince, who was afraid to loſe his Wife and his Child at once, did determine with himſelf to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with the truth; but withall he did ſwear unto her, That if ſhe revealed it to any creature in the world, ſhe ſhould be ſure to die, and by no other hand but his own. To which ſhe condiſcended, and accepted of the puniſhment. Whereupon the poor deceived Husband did account unto her all that he had ſeen, from the beginning to the end; whereat ſhe ſeemed to be very much contented, although her heart was ſurprized with an intolerable anguiſh. Nevertheleſſe, for fear of the Duke, ſhe did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her paſſion as well as poſſibly ſhe could.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Duke made a great Feaſt at his
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:119929:282"/>Court, to which he invited all the Ladies of the Countrey, and amongſt others, his Niece, where Dinner being ended, Dancing did begin, and every Lady did endeavour to ſet forth her ſelf in the beſt manner that ſhe could; but the Dutcheſs, who was tormented to behold the great beauty, and the gracefulneſſe of her Niece, could take no Delight an all, much leſſe could ſhe forbear from making her ſpitefull fury to appear; For after that Dancing was ended, having called all the Ladies together, ſhe cauſed them to ſit down near unto her, and did begin to Diſcourſe unto them concerning the Affairs of Love; And obſerving that her Niece was ſilent, and did ſpeak nothing at all, ſhe ſaid unto her, with a heart inflamed with Jealouſie, And you my fair Niece, Is it poſſible that your Beauty can be without either Friend or Servant? Madam, (ſhe replyed) My Beauty looks not after ſuch a purchaſe, for, ſince the Death of my Husband, I deſire no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sweet-hearts; but only his children, with which I am well contented. Fair Niece, Fair Niece, the Dutcheſſe replyed to her in an extreme Indignation, Fair Niece, Fair Niece. There is no Love ſo ſecret, but may be diſcovered, nor little Doggs ſo well taught and brought up to the hand, whoſe Barking may not be underſtood. Ladies, I leave it to you to imagine, how great a ſorrow on thoſe words ſurprized the heart of the poor young Lady, finding a thing that had been kept ſo cloſe, to be ſo openly declared to her Diſhonour. Her Honor ſo carefully guarded, and ſo unfortunately loſt, did greatly torment her, but moſt of all did the ſtrong ſuſpition ſhe entertained, that her Friend had fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his promiſe; which ſhe thought he never would have done, unleſſe for the Love of ſome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more beautifull than her ſelf, to whom the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his Love did fooliſhly perſwade to declare this effect.</p>
               <p>Her Virtue nevertheleſſe was ſo great, that for all
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:119929:283"/>this apprehenſion ſhe made no apparence of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſmiling, did make anſwer, that ſhe did not underſtand the language of Beaſts, and in this wiſe diſſimulation her heart was ſo overburthened with ſorrow, that ſhe was conſtrained to riſe up, and paſſing by the Chamber of the Dutcheſſe ſhe entred into a Wardrop, where the Duke walking in the Gallery did behold her to goe in. When the poor Lady thought ſhe was in a place where none could either ſoe or hear her, ſhe did throw her ſelf upon the bed with ſo great a violence, that a damoſel who was ſat in a corner of the room to ſleep, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened at it, and did riſe up to ſee who it might be. But finding it was the Niece of the Duke, who thought ſhe had been alone, ſhe durſt not ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, but gently liſtned to the complaint ſhe made. The poor Lady with a voice half dead did begin in theſe words to lament her ſelf. O unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate that I am, What are the words which I have heard? what an arreſt of death have I underſtood by them? What a ſentence to condemn me have I received? O thou the moſt beloved that ever was, Is this the reward of my chaſtity, and of my honeſt and virtuous love? O my heart, why didſt thou make ſo dangerous a choice, to take for the moſt loyal, the moſt unfaithful, for the moſt honeſt, the moſt crafty, for the moſt ſecret, the loudeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractor in the World. Wo is me: Is it poſſible, that a thing hid from the Eyes of all Men, ſhould be revealed to Madam the Dutcheſſe. Alas poor little Dog, the only means of my long and virtuous love, it is not thou that haſt diſcovered me, but he who hath a voice more barking than a Dog, and a heart more ungrateful than any beaſt. He it is, who contrary to his oath and promiſe hath revealed the happy life, which without any prejudice to any, we have a long time lived. O my friend, my friend, whoſe only love is entred into my heart, with whoſe life my own hath been woven, muſt it
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:119929:283"/>now come to paſſe, that in declaring you my mortal Enemy, my Honour muſt be carryed away by the winds, my body crumble into aſhes, and my Soul for ever depart to its laſt place of reſidence? What, was the beauty of the Dutcheſs ſo inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that it hath had the power to transform you, as ſomtimes had that of <hi>Circe?</hi> Hath ſhe made you of virtuous, to become vicious, of good, wicked, of a Man, a Beaſt, a cruel Beaſt. O my Friend, my Friend, although you have failed in your promiſe made to me, yet I will keep my promiſe made to you, which is, that I will never ſee you again after the divulgation of our Love, and being no longer able to live without your preſence, I do willingly accord to the extreme ſorrow which I feel, and for which I will provide no remedy, neither by Reaſon, nor Phyſick, for Death only ſhall put an end to it, which ſhall be more pleaſant to me, than to continue in the World without a Friend, without Honour, and without Contentment. Neither Death, nor the War hath deprived me of my Friend; neither Luſt, nor Rage have taken from me my Honour; neither Deviation, nor Demerit of my own, hath made me to loſe my Contentment: but the cruelty of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, which hath cauſed the moſt obliged of all Men to become the moſt ingratefull. Alas! Madam the Dutcheſſe, What pleaſure was it unto you, when by mockery you did upbraid me with my little Dogg? Go on as you have begun, and continue to delight your ſelf with that happineſſe, which doth belong to me alone. You make your ſport at her, who by wiſely concealing, and who by virtuouſly loving, did promiſe to her ſelf to be exempted from all moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery. O how hath this word contracted my heart? How hath it made me to look red with ſhame, and pale with jealouſie? Wo is me, my heart, my heart, I do feel you can hold out no longer, Love, unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or treacherouſly made known, doth conſume you with Fire; Jealouſie, and the Injury you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:119929:284"/>do freez you with Ice, and with Grief and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation kils you, not permitting the leaſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to arrive. Alas for thee, O my Soul! who by too much adoring the Creature, haſt forgot the Creator. Thou muſt return again into the hands of him, from whom vain Love hath raviſhed thee. Take Confidence, O my Soul, thou ſhalt find God a better Father, than thou haſt found him a Friend, for whom thou ſo often haſt forgot God. O my God, my Creator, who art the true and only Friend, by whoſe Grace the love which I have born unto my Friend hath been ſtained with no Vice, unleſſe by too much loving him, I beſeech thee of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy to receive the Soul, and Spirit of her, who doth truly repent that ſhe hath ſo much diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed thy firſt, and moſt juſt Commandement. And for the merit of him whoſe Love is incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, be pleaſed to excuſe that fault, which too much love hath cauſed me to commit; for in Thee alone I have perfect Confidence: And adieu my falſe Friend, whoſe Name, without the Effect, hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my Heart.</p>
               <p>Having ſpoke thoſe words, ſhe did fall down from the Bed upon the Ground, and her colour waxed pale, and her lips blew; and an univerſal coldneſſe ſeized on every part of her Body. At that inſtant the Gentleman who did love her came into the hall, and ſeeing the Dutcheſſe dancing with the other Ladies, looked every where up and down where his Miſtreſſe was, and not finding her, he did repair into the Chamber of the Dutcheſſe, near unto which he found the Duke walking in the Gallery, who, conjecturing what his thoughts were, did whiſper him in the ear, and ſaid, Your Sweet-heart is gone into yonder Wardrobe, I am afraid ſhe is not well. The Gentleman demanded of him, that he would be pleaſed to give him leave to wait upon her, to which the Duke was eaſily intreated. As ſoon as he was entred into the Wardrobe, he found that ſhe
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:119929:284"/>was even ready to breath forth the laſt breath of her life, and falling down on his knees, he imbraced her, and ſaid unto her, O my dear Love, How do you do? What, will you forſake me? The poor Lady hearing the voice which ſo well ſhe knew, did begin a little to recover her colour, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her eyes, ſhe looked ſtedfaſtly on him who was the occaſion of her Death. But ſo looking on him, Love and Deſpite did ſo violently increaſe upon her, that with a pittifull ſigh ſhe rendred her Soul to God. The Gentleman, more dead than ſhe that was dead, did demand of the Damoſel, How that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity ſeized upon her? who all along did account unto him the words which ſhe had heard her ſpeak; whereupon he immediately perceived, that the Duke had revealed the Secret to the Dutcheſſe, and was tranſported with ſo great a fury, that, imbracing the Body of his Sweet-heart, he did along time bedew it with his tears, and at laſt ſaid, Wo is me! the moſt treacherous, moſt wicked, and the moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Man in the world. How is it come to paſſe that the puniſhment of my Treaſon is not fallen on my ſelf, but on her who is innocent? O why did Heaven ſpare me? Why did not Thunder check my Tongue in that hour, when I firſt revealed our moſt ſecret, and moſt virtuous Love? Why did not the Earth open her ſelf? Why did it not devour this unadviſed Breaker of his Faith? Be thou puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, O my tongue, as was the tongue of the rich Glutton in Hell: O my heart, be thou perpetually torn in pieces by Eagles, as was the heart of <hi>Titius.</hi> O Dear Sweet-heart! the moſt unfortunate misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of all misfortunes is befallen me. Thinking to have preſerved you, I have loſt you; thinking to ſee you live a long time with content, I imbrace you diſcontented, and dead. O thou the moſt loyal, and the moſt faithfull Woman that ever was, I ſhall by all be condemned to be the moſt inconſtant, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal, and the moſt unfaithful man in the world. I
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:119929:285"/>might complain of the Duke, in whoſe promiſe I ſo much truſted, hoping by that to give a longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance to our happy life, but alas I might know, that no man could keep my ſecret better than my ſelf. The Duke had more reaſon to impart it unto his Wife, than I to impart it unto him. I can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe none but my ſelf of the greateſt diſloyalty that ever was committed by a Lover, I had better by far be thrown into the River, accordingly as the Duke did threaten, that thou my dear friend mightſt be preſerved alive, and I gloriouſly might have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in obſerving the laws which true love comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, but breaking them I remain alive, and thou who moſt perfectly did love art dead. Thy heart ſo pure and undefiled, could not without death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to underſtand the Vice which was in me your friend. O my God, wherefore didſt thou create me a Man, having a love ſo light, and a heart ſo ignorant? Why didſt not thou rather create me a little dogg, who ſo faithfully did know to ſerve his Miſtreſſe. Alas little Dog, the joy which thy bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king brought unto me is now turned into perpetual mourning, becauſe by my means another was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to hear thy voice. But ſo it is dear friend, that neither the Love of the Dutcheſſe, nor of any Woman in the World hath cauſed me to change my affections, although ſhe oftentimes hath importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me to it. But ignorance overcame me, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ever to preſerve your Love; but this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot excuſe me, for I have revealed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of my friend, I have falſified my promiſe, which is the only cauſe that I ſee you dead before my eyes. Shall death be leſſe cruel to me than to your ſelf; who only for Love have put an end to your innocent life? I muſt believe, ſhall I believe that death will not vouchſafe to touch my unfaithful and accurſed heart, for a diſhonourable life, and the memory of my loſſe through my own default, is more inſupportable than ten thouſand deaths. Woe
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:119929:285"/>is me my friend! If any one either through malice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r misfortune had been ſo cruel as to kill you, I ſhould readily have put my hand upon my Sword to have revenged you: It is no reaſon therefore that I ſhould pardon the murtherer who was the occaſion of your death, and by a more unrighteous act than to have killed you with a Sword. If I knew any more wicked Executioner than my ſelf, I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to ſee Juſtice performed on your treacherous friend. O Love! By the ignorance of loving I have offended thee, and wilt not thou relieve me as thou didſt her, who inviolately did keep all thy Laws. Is it nor reaſon that by the like honeſt means I doe end my life? It is, and moſt reaſonable it is that it be done by my own hand, and ſince with my tears I have bathed your face, and with my Tongue I have required pardon of you, nothing now remains but that with my own hand I doe render my body like unto yours, and that my Soul do follow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever yours is gone before me, knowing that a virtuous and an honeſt love can have no end, either in this world, or in the World to come. And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately riſing from the body, as a man tranſported, and out of his ſenſe, he drew his Sword, and fixing the pummel of it againſt the Wall, and the point of it againſt his Breſt, he with great violence did drive it quite through his body, and falling down he took his Sweet-heart in his arms, and did kiſſe and imbace her with ſuch affection, that he ſeemed to be more ſurprized by love than by death. The Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel obſerving him to draw his Sword, did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately run forth to cry out for help. The Duke hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the cry, and doubting ſome ſad accident had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen thoſe whom he moſt intirely loved, was the firſt that came into the Wardrop, and beholding this lamentable ſpectacle he endeavoured to take off the Gentleman from the body of the dead Lady, if it were poſſible to ſave him, but he held his Sweet-heart ſo faſt in his arms, that he could not ſever him from her
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:119929:286"/>with all the ſtrength he had, until he was quite dead himſelf. Nevertheleſſe, underſtanding that the Duke did ſpeak unto him, and demanded who was the occaſion of it, he did lift up his head, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furiouſly upon him, he made anſwer, Your Tongue (Sir,) and my own, and bowing down his head again, he immediately dyed, his face being cloſe joyned to that of his Friends.</p>
               <p>The Duke deſiring to be thoroughly informed with all the particulars of this Tragedy, did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Damoſel to declare at large unto him, whatſoever ſhe had ſeen or heard, which ſhe did, all along, without ſparing any thing; whereupon the Duke perceiving that he was the Original of all this Evil, did throw himſelf upon the two dead Lovers, and with great Lamentation, craving pardon of them for his offence, he oftentimes did kiſs them, &amp; riſing from them in a fury, he drew out the ſword fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead body of the Gentleman, And as a wild Boar being wounded by a Lance doth run with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtleſſe violence at him who made the thruſt, ſo the Duke did addreſſe himſelf to her who had wounded him quite through his Soul. He found her, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Hall, and more frolick by farr than ſhe was accuſtomed to be, conceiving that in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe had revenged her ſelf upon the Niece of the Duke. In the middle of the Dance the Duke did lay hold on her, and ſaid unto her, you promiſed not to reveal the Secret upon the forfeit of your life; And your life ſhall anſwer for your treſpaſſe, and ſpeaking thoſe words, he took her by her Headgeer, and ſheathed the ſword in her Body, at which all the Company were ſo amazed, that they conceiv'd the Duke was bereaved of his Senſes.</p>
               <p>Having thus put a violent period to the Life of his Dutcheſſe, he called together his Friends, and his Servants, and did declare unto them the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt virtuous ſtory of his Niece, and the great Injury that his Wife had done her, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed many tears in all the ſtanders by. The Duke
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:119929:286"/>afterwards commanded, that his Wife ſhould be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in an Abbey which he had founded, and cauſed a fair Sepulcher to be builded, where the bodies of his Niece, and of the Gentleman were interred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and an Epitaph was laid upon the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, declaring the Hiſtory of their loves, and their Tragical Deaths. The Duke afterwards did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a Voyage againſt the Turks, and God ſo proſpered him, that he atchieved great honours, and gained large Revenues. And on his Return finding his eldeſt Son able to manage the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Eſtate, he did put on the habit of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the ſame Abbey where his Wife and the two Lovers were buried, where devoutly he paſſed away the Remainder of his life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ladies, this is the Hiſtory which you have intreated me to declare unto you, and which I perceive by your eyes that you have not received without compaſſion; From hence methinks we ought to take an Example, to have a care not to fix too much our affections on men; For how honeſt and virtuous ſoever the love may ſeem to be in the beginning; yet for the moſt part it goes off with an unpleaſing Farewell. And moreover you may read, that Saint</hi> Paul <hi>would not that married people ſhould ſet altogether their affections on one another; for by how much the more our hearts are ingaged in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Love, by ſo much the leſſe they are addicted to the Love of Heaven, and spiritual things, and the more noble, and the more virtuous the Love is, the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult it is to break the bonds. And this (Ladies) doth excite me to intreat you, that every hour you would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God his Holy Spirit, that your hearts may be inflamed on his Love, and that you may find no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the hour of Death, to forſake that which too much in the world you loved. If their love was ſo virtuous ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>as you deſcribe it, what was the reaſon, that it was kept ſo ſecret. Becauſe</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Parlament) <hi>the malice of Men is ſuch, they will not believe that a great Love, as ſuch as this was, can ever be joyned
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:119929:287"/>with honeſty, for they judge of virtuous Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men according to their own paſſions, and for that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it is requiſite, that if a virtuous Woman doth pleaſe to entertain a virtuous Friend, ſhe muſt diſcourſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetly with him if ſhe intends to diſcourſe long with him, for the Honour of a woman is as apt to be diſputed on, for loving according to the Laws of Virtue, as to the unruly inſtructions of Vice; for we judge not but only according to apparence. You ſay ſomething indeed, ſaid</hi> Guebron, <hi>but when the ſecret comes to be revealed, we judge not oftentimes ſo bad as there is occaſion for. I do confeſſe it in ſome caſes, ſaid</hi> Longaren, <hi>and therefore the beſt courſe is not to love at all. We will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from that Sentence, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>for if we thought Ladies were without love, we could wiſh our ſelves without life: We underſtand that they only live to be beloved, and although it ſometimes doth fall out, that they doe miſſe of this love, yet hope doth ſustain them, and doth cauſe them to perform a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand honourable actions until old age doth change their honeſt deſires into more ſanctified reſolutions. They who would deprive us of the Love of Women, muſt take Arms and Honour from Men, and make them all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and inſtead of acts of Chivalry muſt make it their only buſineſſe to heap up riches. If it were not then for Women, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>you will ſay that we were miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched, as if Men had no hearts but what Women do give unto them. But I am of a contrary opinion, &amp; do believe that there is nothing which doth more abate the heart of Man than too much to love Women, and to frequent their converſation. And for that occaſion it is, that the Hebrews were forbid to go unto the warrs, in that year wherein they were married, for fear that the love of the Wife ſhould draw him from thoſe dangers which there he is bound to undergo. For my own part, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>I find no great reaſon in that Law, for there is nothing that can make a Man ſooner to goe out of his Houſe than to be married, for the Warrs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors are always more grateful and more tollerable
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:119929:287"/>than that within, and I do believe that to give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to men to travel into forein Countreys, and not ſlothfully to amuſe themſelves at their own fires, they ought to marry. It is true, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>that marriage doth take from them all care of their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for being married they truſt altogether to their Wives, and they think on nothing themſelves, but on the purchaſe of Honour, being confident that their Wives at home will take care enough for their profit. In whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſenſe you will render it, ſaid</hi> Saffredant, <hi>I am very glad that you are of my opinion. But all this while, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>you diſcourſe not of that which is moſt conſiderable, which is, why the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which was the occaſion of this moſt unhappy acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, did not die of meer ſorrow as well as the young Gentlewoman who was innocent.</hi> Nomerfide <hi>made anſwer to her, It is becauſe that women do love better and more faithfully than Men. No, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>It is becauſe the jealouſie and the deſire of Women do make them believe that which they have no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and the Wiſedom of Men doth direct them to ſeek after the Truth only, which being rightly underſtood doth ſhow the greatneſſe of their hearts, as is apparent by this Gentleman, who having underſtood that he was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the death of his Sweet-heart, did make it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable how much he did love her, without sparing his own life. Howſoever, ſaid</hi> Emarſuite, <hi>ſhe died for true love, for her faithfull and loyal heart could not endure to be ſo unexpectedly betrayed. It was not Love but Jealouſie, ſaid</hi> Simontault, <hi>which would give no place to reaſon; and becauſe ſhe did believe that Evil to be in her friend, which indeed was not as ſhe thought it was, her death was conſtrained by an exceſſe of grief, for it lay not in her power to help it; but the death of her friend was voluntary and of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, after he knew the injury he had done her. The Love muſt needs be great, ſaid</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo great a ſorrow. You need not fear at all, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>that you will ever die of that Feaver. And as
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:119929:288"/>much I dare undertake for you</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> Nomerfide) <hi>you will never kill your ſelf after you have known your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Parlament, <hi>doubting their debate might prove to her expence, did, ſmiling, ſay unto them, It is enough that two already have been dead for Love, let Love let you two alone; And (hark,) this is the laſt time that the Bell rings in to Vespers, Will you go, or no? Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thoſe words, the Company all did riſe, and did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Evening Song, not forgetting in their good prayers the ſoules of true Lovers, for which the Monks of their own accord did ſing their Hymn</hi> De profundis: <hi>And afterwards as long as Supper did continue, they had no other diſcourſe, but of Madam</hi> Du Verger, <hi>and having for a pretty while paſſed away their time in ſuch Conference, they did all retire into their Chambers, and did put an End to the Accounts of the ſeventh day.</hi>

One day it was told him that his Wife was fall'n very ſick on the ſudden, and was in great danger of Death, whereat he ſeemed to be as ſorrowfull as poſſibly a man might be, and in great diligence did make haſt to her relief, he found her in that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate condition, that ſhe had more need of the Prieſt to confeſſe her, than of the Phyſician to cure her, and therefore he made for her the greateſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation in the world; And the better to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it, he ſpake faintly, and with a hollow accent in the throat, as did the dying woman his Wife, and that Painter muſt be a good workman, who could lively ſet forth the ſadneſs of his look and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. After that he had done her all the ſervices that poſſibly he could, ſhe commanded that a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex ſhould be brought unto her; which the good man perceiving, he did caſt himſelf upon the bed, &amp; thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Wife paſt all hopes of Recovery, he cryed out, and fumbling with his tongue, did expoſtulate, O God! what ſhall I do, I ſhall loſe my poor Wife, what ſhall become of me wretched and unhappy man? with divers other complaints. At the laſt, when he perceived that there was no body in the Chamber but his dying Wife, and a young Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bermaid, beautiful enough, and in good liking, he called her ſoftly to him, and ſaid unto her, Sweet-heart, I am even dying my ſelf, to ſee thy Miſtreſſe to be a dying Woman, I know not well what to ſay, or what to do, but onely to recommend my ſelf to thee, and to deſire thee to take care of my houſe and Children: Here, take the keys which are han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by my ſide, and look well to my Houſhold, for I ſhall not be able to look after them any more.</p>
               <p>The poor Girl being touched with compaſſion to hear thoſe words, did comfort him what ſhe could, and did beſeech him that he would not fall into ſo great a Deſpair; for if ſhe muſt loſe her Miſtreſſe, ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould not loſe her good Maſter alſo.
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:119929:291"/>He made anſwer to her, Sweet-heart, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for I find my ſelf to be but a dying Man. See how the cold ſweat ſtands upon my Brow, put your Cheek unto mine, and your Lip to my Lip, And ſpeaking thoſe words, he did thruſt his hand into her Breſt, whereat the Maid begun to make ſome difficulty, but he deſired her to put away all fear, for if ſhe hoped for his recovery, ſhe muſt come nearer to him, and with thoſe words he did take her in his Arms, and did throw her on the bed. His Wife who had no other Company but the Crucifix, and the Holy water, and had not ſpoken in two days before, did begin with her weak voice to cry out as loud as poſſibly ſhe could. Ah Ha! what do you doe? I am not dead as yet; and threatning them with her hand, ſhe ſaid unto them, You wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Creatures, I am not yet dead.</p>
               <p>Her Husband and the Chambermaid hearing of her voice, did immediately riſe, but ſhe was ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely incenſed againſt them, that her choler con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed all the moiſture of her Catarrhe, by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance whereof ſhe before ratled in the throat, &amp; not colud ſpeak a word, but now ſhe did give them all the opprobrious terms that poſſibly ſhe could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe.

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:119929:292"/>or eight Monks who every day ſaid the Service, as the Nuns did only their <hi>Pater-nofters,</hi> and the Hours of our Lady, becauſe they were to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the attendance of thoſe who were ſick. There dyed one day a poor man, where all the Religious women aſſembled themſelves, and having uſed all the Remedies that poſſibly they could for the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his health, they ſent for one of the Monks to confeſſe him; and becauſe they did obſerve that he did grow weaker and weaker, they did give him the Unction, and not long afterwards he became ſpeechleſſe: But becauſe he was a long time paſſing away, and did make as though he did hear, although he could not ſpeak, every one of the Nuns did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give him the beſt exhortations that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they could, in which good work they ſo long continued, that at the laſt they were all weary, for ſeeing that night approached, and that he was long a dying, they did go to bed one after another, and none ſtayed to attend the hour of his departure, or to bury, his Body being dead, but one of the youngeſt Nuns, &amp; one of the Monks, whom ſhe feared more than the Prior himſelf, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, by reaſon of the great auſterity which he uſed, as well in his converſation as his words, who when they had a pretty while cryed <hi>JESUS</hi> in the ear of the poor Man, they knew for certain that he was dead, wherefore theſe two without any other aſſiſtance did put him into the Grave.</p>
               <p>Exerciſing this laſt work of Charity, the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man began to diſcourſe of the miſery of this life, and of the happineſſe and the glory of the life to come, and in this devout diſcourſe they did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till Midnight. The poor young Nun did lend a moſt attentive ear to his devout exhortations, and looked on him, the tears trickling down her eyes, in which he took ſo great a pleaſure, that talking to her of the life to come, he did begin to imbrace her, as if he had a great deſire to carry her
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:119929:292"/>at that inſtant in his arms directly unto Paradiſe. The poor Girl liſtning to his Diſcourſe, and eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him to be the moſt devout, and the uprighteſt man in all the Priory, durſt not refuſe him, which the wicked Monk obſerving, in talking to her of God, did perform the work which the Devil on the ſudden had put into his heart; (for before there was never the leaſt motion of any love betwixt them) The Monk aſſured her, that a Secret Sin was not puniſhed; and that two perſons not bound in Matrimony could not offend, when no Scandal did ariſe from thence; and therefore to avoid all danger of Scandal, he adviſed her, that ſhe ſhould confeſſe her ſelf unto none but unto him; And thus they departed, and ſhe going firſt out of doors, paſſing by the Chapel of our Lady, did go in to ſay her Devotions as ſhe was accuſtomed to do, but when ſhe began to ſay, <hi>Virgo Maria,</hi> ſhe remembred that ſhe had loſt that Title of Virginity, without force, or love, but only by a ſottiſh fear; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe did begin to weep ſo abundantly, as if ſhe would have melted her ſelf all into water. The Monk did hear her ſighs and complaints, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her converſion by which he might have loſt his pleaſure, did diſſwade her from it, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, That if ſhe was troubled in Conſcience for what ſhe had done, ſhe ſhould confeſſe her ſelf unto him. The fooliſh Nun thinking to ſatisfie God, did confeſſe her ſelf unto him, who gave her no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther penitence, but did ſwear unto her, That ſhe did not ſin at all to love him, and that a little holy water could waſh away the ſtain of ſuch a venial Treſpaſſe. She truſting in him more than in God, at the end of a certain time did return to him again to obey him in what he deſired; inſomuch that ſhe was great with Child, whereat ſhe was ſo extremely ſorrowfull, that ſhe deſired the Prioreſſe not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that Monk to come again into the Monaſtery, knowing that he was ſo ſubtil, and ſo ſerpentine,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:119929:293"/>that he would prevail upon her to believe what he pleaſed. The Prioreſſe and the Prior who did agree very well together, did both mock at her, and told her that ſhe was big enough to defend her ſelf from a Man. At the laſt in a great conſternation of mind, and ſtung with the remorſe of Conſcience, ſhe demanded leave of them to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> for ſhe thought that if ſhe could but confeſſe her Sin at the feet of the Pope, ſhe ſhould recover her virginity. To this deſire both the Prior and the Prioreſs did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry readily agree, for they had rather that (againſt the Rule) ſhe ſhould be a Pilgrim, than continue a Recluſe, and in ſo troubled a condition of mind; Wherefore fearing that her deſpair would cauſe her to reveal the life which they did lead in that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, they gave her money to ſatisfie for the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of her Journey. But God ſo pleaſed, that being at <hi>Lyons,</hi> one Evening after Veſpers in Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Church, where Madam the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Alençon,</hi> who hath been ſince Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi> did walk in private to exerciſe her Devotions, with three or four of her Women who were on their Knees before the Crucifix, ſhe heard ſome body to goe up the ſtairs, &amp; by the light of the Lamp did perceive that it was a Nun, And the better to liſten to her Devotions, ſhe did retire her ſelf to the Corner of the Altar. The Nun who thought ſhe was alone, kneeled down, and beating her ſelf with her hand on the Breſt in the manifeſtation of her contrition for her fault, did weep ſo abundantly, that it was pitty to ſee her, and with her hands lifted up repeated only theſe words, O my God have mercy upon me a Sinner. The Dutcheſſe, the better to underſtand who ſhe was, did come more near, and ſaid unto her, My Friend, what are you? whence doe you come? and who brought you to this place? The poor Nun who did not know her, did make anſwer, Woe is me (my friend) my misfortune is ſo great that I have no recourſe but unto God only, whom I
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:119929:293"/>doe beſeech to vouchſafe unto me the means that I may ſpeak to Madam the Dutcheſſe of <hi>Alençon,</hi> for to her alone will I declare my buſineſs, being confident that if there be any redreſs for ſuch a miſerable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as my ſelf, ſhe will grant it to me. Friend (ſaid the Dutcheſs to her) you may ſpeak as confidently unto me as unto her, I am one of her grateſt friends. Pardon me (ſaid the Nun) none but her ſelf only ſhall underſtand my ſecret. Whereupon the Dutcheſſe ſaid unto her, that ſhe might ſpeak freely, for ſhe had found her whom ſhe demanded. The poor Nun did proſtrate her ſelf at her feet, and having wept a long time, ſhe gave her the whole account of what already I have expreſſed unto you, whereupon the Dutcheſſe did comfort her ſo well, that exhorting her to repentance for her miſdeed, ſhe took from her quite the reſolution of going to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent her back to the Prioreſſe, with a ſtrict charge to entertain her, and with Letters to the Biſhop of that place to take order for the expulſion of that ſcandalous Monk, who having abuſed the Body of the Nun, did afterwards moſt petulantly upbraid her, and cauſed her to depart the Covent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I received this Acount from the Dutcheſſe her ſelf, by which (Ladies) you may underſtand, that the Rule of</hi> Nomerfide <hi>is not proper to all ſorts of Perſons; for theſe two both touching aed burying the dead were neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe at the ſame time touched and overcome with infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was an invention, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>which I believe was never practiſed before, to speak of death, and at the ſame inſtant to do the works of life. It is not, ſaid</hi> Oyſilla, <hi>any work of life to ſin, for we all know well enough that ſin produceth death. You may believe, ſaid</hi> Saſſredant, <hi>that at that time neither the Monk nor the Nun had the leaſt thought of that Divinity, but as the Daughters of</hi> Lot, <hi>having made their Father drunk, did think by that means to preſerve human Nature, ſo this Monk and the Nun would repair that which death
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:119929:294"/>had deſtroyed by making of a new Body. Therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reflect again upon the tears of tho Nun, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wept, and always returned to the cauſe of her weeping. I have ſeen too many of thoſe, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>who at the ſame time bewailed their ſins, and yet kept their pleaſures. I do much doubt, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>by whom you do speak thoſe words, wherefore it ſeems to me that their laughter hath laſted long enough, it would be now time that weeping ſhould begin. Hold your peace, ſaid</hi> Hircan, <hi>The Tragedy is not yet finiſhed which doth begin with laughter. But to change the Subject of our diſcourſe, ſaid</hi> Parlament, <hi>it ſeems to me that</hi> Dagou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin <hi>hath wandred from our firſt determination, which was that the Accounts of this day ſhould be all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and this hath been a ſad one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You made a motion, ſaid</hi> Dagoucin, <hi>that we ſhould not forget to give an Account of the greateſt follies, and in that I am ſure I have not failed; but to hear one that is more pleaſant, I do give my voice to</hi> Nomerfide, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that ſhe will mend my fault. She made anſwer, I have an Account ready for you, and one which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to follow yours, for it ſpeaks of Religious perſons, and of death alſo. Give ear unto it if you pleaſe.</hi>
